The us is the second most polluting country in the world - as the world‚Äôs biggest industrial and commercial power. we are all to blame here and need to work hand in hand to create sustainable change, as opposed to pointing the finger to others.
Doesn't everyone on the planet have a responsibility towards the climate?
The world would be a better place if people were more tolerant to each other.
You're right, ocean pollution is one of the main environmental problems we face, however, climate change is a global problem, and everyone should help to combat it, no matter where in the world you are from!
Anti-semitism is a serious problem that we need to address and stop spreading relentless hate against people who are innocent.
Want to try a nuke then?
Really? i'd sit with a group of jews any day.
We need to understand from where this hate stems from. stop hating, start loving. the human race needs to be more appreciative of one another.
You seem to be worried about government expenditure‚Ä¶ it has actually been shown that,over time, migration reduces pressure on government spending ‚Äì because migrants are more likely to be young adult workers.
Do you even have the background information on this to be making such a strong statement?
Do you know how much money foreigners are giving the uk in taxes? if you knew that then you would see how much we have to thank them for. maybe it would be better to focus on stopping tax evasion.
I can understand that you‚Äôre frustrated ‚Äì austerity has hit so many of us horribly, but your blame is directed to the wrong people. migrants are statistically less likely to claim benefits, plus they‚Äôre not easy to access anyway. most people receiving benefits in the uk are actually in work, direct your anger towards better pay and conditions!
You can have parents and grandparents born elsewhere, and still be a patriot for the country you were born in.
If you personally had some distant spanish or jewish heritage and you identified more as american surely that doesn't mean that you can't be an american patriot?
My best friend is jewish, she volunteers to help woman, disadvantages children, and her whole family work to make the uk a better place.
It is possible to love one's country and one's religious home. the two are not exclusive.
Wouldn't you say its colonialism from many different countries and the consequesequences of western intervention abroad which led to a lot of radicalisation and extremism?
Where are the facts?
Alternatively, i think that the main causes of radicalisation and extremism are colonialism and the many western military interventions abroad.
I believe that pointing fingers and hating without cause is not the right way to go about things. this who dun it attitude will not abide if we want to be a peaceful race.
The difference between these two individuals has nothing to do with race or gender, it is individual lifestyle and cultural difference.
Why use cultural differences to justify your racism?
Women are women the world over, full stop.
Lifestyles, cultural, and geographical differences are not the same as race. please get your facts straight and educate yourself.
Without women there would be no men.
What makes you think that women are jealous of men? what qualities do you value as a white male?
What's useless is your uniformed generalization about an entire sex.
Women and men, while being physically different, have no other disparities. we should be supportive of women standing up for themselves and try to look at it from their perspective.
Maybe the roots of white supremacy deriving from centuries of mass colonisation, slavery and domination over others, are the reason that white supremacy is such a problem.
Have you considered equality rather than supremacy?
Don't justify your racism on baseless logic. get a life.
Why do we need supremacy? we are all created equal in the eyes of god.
And yet genocides have happened across the world since. perhaps, the holocaust would be forgotten if it's lessons had been learned but they haven't.
Are you aware of all the genocides that have happened since the holocaust?
Milking it? millions of people suffered during this tragedy
We should be respectful and compassionate towards those who suffered in one of the most horrific event in the history of mankind... i think this should be remembered forever!
Who is 'we', surely it was men and women working together that built civilisation? why is it you think being 'soft' is a problem? everyone is entitled to their emotions, and men shouldn't have to 'man up'.
Isn't having different energy levels and thought patterns better for building a civilization?
Don't be a misogynist. stop spreading hate.
Women can sometimes be in a different headspace than men, and the reasons can be purely biological. please try to be considerate, spread love.
Your statement suggests that white people cordon off areas for themselves first which prevent jews from accessing those areas.
How can both parts of your statement be true at the same time?
Your statement suggests that white people cordon off areas for themselves first, which invalidates your point further.
Instead of fighting for land, we could all live in harmony and peace amongst one another. life is too short to hate on people.
Al-qaeda had claimed responsibility for the london and new york attacks. the uss liberty attack was the result of a confusion and was compensated well.
Where is the proof of this? looks like assumptions as opposed to facts...
This is just an unfounded conspiracy theory that only harms people.
Terrorism, as awful as it is, will not be solved if all we do is point fingers at the wrong person. united we stand, divided we fall.
Curious why you focus on 'zionists' when there are fundamentalists linked to many different faiths?
What's your proof for claiming this?
Why should they? i wonder if you have any evidence that makes you believe this.
Folks are usually as happy as they make their minds up to be. try to love people, you will find peace. cheers.
Your comment does not explain even a shred of the point that you are trying to convey. please present some factual points from the next time.
What would it explain? this comment is very vague i wonder if you have any facts that make you wonder this.
Please stop spreading hate. we should all move on towards a brighter note.
The broad consensus among economists is that it is likely to harm the uk's economy and reduce its real per capita income in the long term, and that the referendum itself damaged the economy.
What makes you think that? do you have any facts to back this up?
You are in the wrong here if you think brexit is in any way good for the combined population of eu. get your facts straight before dumping your opinions on the internet.
We should focus on a better quality of life, fairer welfare, and an overall better system for our own and others coming in to our countries, and not point fingers at anyone.
We do have to choose. it's ok to accept them both.
It is absolutely possible for people of all cultures to integrate and contribute to our communities, why don't you believe this notion?
Your comment is both islamophobic and anti-semitic. we all should choose to not listen to you.
We can choose not to hate, and start to build bridges so we understand each other.
Same sex relationship happen within many species of animals and we are no exception. might as well inform people about things that happen in nature - that's the point of education, to learn about the world.
We are always developing as time goes on and same sex relationships are a part of the world now, why would we not educate our children on different ways of life?
Inclusive education will help in reducing exactly this kind of ignorance and misinformation.
This is about teaching children about the world they live in, and helping them get on with others.
Anti-hate organisations are doing brilliant work, and isn't getting rid of hate speech a good thing?
The internet has become a shouting platform for people's hateful views. of course something needs to be done since people don't seem able to moderate their words themselves.
Sadly people need censoring, to stop them spreading hate,.
To recognise and accept practices that we don't take part in isn't state inforcement. it's just stating facts and stopping persecution of people who have different preferences.
Why is it so hard for people to mind their own business and let humans love who they want to love? isn't this played out already?
It is always an acheivement to celebrate equality and acceptance, especially when it was long due. you need to keep your opinions in check.
Respecting people with different habits that do not harm anyone is a monumental achievement indeed!
To have a more positive political environment, inclusivity and representation of all types of people is necessary, therefore women do belong in politics
Feminism is a social movement for gender equality, and wouldn't you say that feminism has worked in the modern world?
Women comprise of almost fifty percent of world population. rather, ignoring their efforts and inputs would be harmul for any civilization.
Our goal as a democratic society is to have a more positive and respectful political environment, where inclusivity and representation of all types of people is enforced. therefore women do belong in politics.
Ethnic minorities is a term used within a specific context, here for example, in the uk, people from these countries are minorities.
Since when was great britain an ethnic group? or pakistan for that matter. or nigeria...etc
I don't think you even know the definition of a minority. please get your definitions right before you spew hate online.
These groups tend to be a minority in britian. either way, everyone deserves respect and protection and human rights.
There are more than enough empty homes in this country right now to house every single homeless person. there is also more than enough wealth in this country to build new homes. we can house our ‚Äòown people‚Äô but the government chooses not to. homelessness is an issue of wealth inequality not migration ‚Äì if you genuinely care about poverty issues like homelessness you need to be questioning power structures and wealth distribution.
Is it due to immigration, or the lack of affordable housing, unemployment, poverty, mental illness and the lack of needed services, substance abuse and the lack of services? do i need to go on?
There are so many empty homes in our country that we could house every single homeless person, without the need to build a single apartment. it is the government that chooses not to. homelessness is about wealth inequality not migration. if you genuinely care about poverty you need to question power structures and wealth distribution.
Asylum seekers and refugees deserve our compassion, not condemnation.
The womenfolk appear to have wisdom and not a little heart.
Do you even know what you are saying? what point are you trying to make?
Your comment is wrong in so many ways. refrain from spreading hate without proper factual information.
Women can be just as innovative, powerful and amazing humans as men.
The ultra rich people in this industry - jewish or not - have the power and influence. not sure where you got your facts from regarding jewish people controlling hollywood.
If the jewish community was controlling these kind of industries, they would surely make a high priority of jewish concerns?
This is absolutely not true. this is just plain hate. there is no evidence of control of jews anywhere in hollywood.
Let us not spread meaningless hate, and try to think logically. facts, not feelings.
Feminist.com, read more on the 'man up campaign' on mind.org.uk
Feminism is first and foremost a battle for the equal rights of all sexes, so a fight for this surely has nothing to do with procreation and civilisation?
Women have just realised that they can do whatever they want to, instead of following age-old norms. refrain from being a misogynist.
Feminism is about equal rights between men and women, and challenges socially imposed burdens upon both men and women.
The nazi killing machine was all too efficient. survivors lost so much and braved terror and cruelty. they should be celebrated.
So you are mad that some heroic people actually survived such an awful situation which doomed their entire country for so long?
The murder of around 6 million jews shows the scale of the genocide. this is 6 million more than should have ever happened.
The holocaust was hugely tragic, and we are blessed to have holocaust survivors to hear from. they tell an important story that we must learn from.
The jews suffered horribly in the holocaust, as did many other groups.reparation is a small step to enable suffering people to rebuild their lives. common humanity, surely?
Reparation is a historical process and has happened in many contexts. after ww1 when europe wanted massive reperations from germany for example? it's a normal and established process, and when so many people have lost their lives it makes perfect sense.
Are you implying that reparitions for an attempt at ethnic cleansing on a huge scale is an unreasonable request?
Reparations for an attempt at ethnic cleansing on a huge scale seems reasonable to me...
People who vote for parties which target the most powerful are often mostly concerned about making it financially until the next month. redistributing wealth from people who have way too much money seems fair, not threatening.
How can you even say such a wrong thing? there is not a shred of evidence for what you claim.
It is essential that, in a diverse community, every citizen get a say in their own welfare and way of life. who people vote for determines this.
Not sure how reading a book is a problem, sounds pretty nice for the kids. it is not a matter of doctrine, its simple biology.
People reading stories to children, teaching them about the world?
I can't say i've ever come across 'fag pride'. gay pride or lgbt+ pride, perhaps?
Children should be given the right to learn about all of these things, it will definitely help those who are confused, or are struggling. it is not a matter of doctrine, its simple biology.
I wonder how you account for refugees who are fleeing wars and a lack of security for their themselves and their families. wars which are often directly or indirectly caused by western powers who created long lasting problems abroad.
I belonged to europe, to germany, and i thanked my creator that i was german - victor klemperer speaking of his experience in ww1, explaining his dislike of russian jews... do you feel better now that we proved that jews hate everybody? #sarcasm
People bring such unbelievable ideas to hide their prejudice and hate behind them
My best friend is jewish, she volunteers to help woman, and disadvantaged children, and her whole family work to make the uk a better place.
Child molestors can have any sexual orientations and the majority of straight or gay people are not child molestors. this is an issue that can affect anyone regardless of sexual orientation.
How would you feel about being accused of molesting children, just because of your sexual orientation?
Child molesters are not all gay, just as men are not all rapists.
If you are saying this just to incite outrage, please stop. queer people already receive a lot of hate and it is unfair. they are only human, who are doing nothing wrong.
Eviction from a privately rented home is one of the leading causes of homelessness. short contracts, unfair evictions, and sky-high rents mean people struggle to keep a roof over their head. nowhere does it say that migrants are a cause.
How many people walked by and did nothing? is the problem uncontrolled immigration or indifference of our society?
These are legitimate political problems that have nothing to do with migrants. please refrain from blaming them for every problem that arises in the economy.
Rather than blaming the poor migrants for the entire homelessness problem, we should look to build welfare among those who struggle, and hold out a hand of humanity to those who need help.
2018 saw america take in the fewest refugees in the last 40 years.
Where are the statistics? and if you don't have any, then do you think it is valid to blame all our problems on a religion or be so hateful to migrants?
Blaming all our issues on someone else seems like a habit of yours. your thoughts seem to occupied of hate and prejudice so that you are resorting to such a mindless conspiracy.
I wish people would look more on the bright side of things. migrants and refugees come here to find better lives, and we should be glad that we are able to provide them. jews are also nice people who just happen to follow a different religion and they love this country just as much as you.
The problem here is not whether they should or shouldn't come, but it's about how they're getting treated while in detention. it wouldn't be bad to put them in temporary detention humanely.
Is it due to immigration, or mismanagment of funds, rising inflation, income imbalance or any other more economic hurdles that we need to overcome?
We all know the problem is not migrants and solution is not sending them back. then why wallow in unfounded hate?
Sounds like you are concerned about migrants who are unable to find proper facilities at migrant centers. that is actually a valid concern. but the solution is not sending them back, because there is a reason why they came here. it will be better if we all can take our time to help them.
It should be mandatory to treat prisoners with respect and with the corresponding rights. we are in the 21st century, it is a duty.
If we really have many illegal immigrants, then wouldn't it make sense to actually understand the reason why they are here? can we really judge someone's circumstances when we live in all these benefits?
Calm down with the hate.
It should be mandatory to treat prisoners with respect and with the corresponding rights.
Our country offers enough homes for everyone. i also believe that being treated as a human being has always been pleasant. don't they have the right to that?
Do you really think migrants offer nothing to england?
How selfish of you to say this. migrants deserve to be treated like any other citizens, not to be hated by the likes of you.
People from around the world come to places like the eu to have a better life, and deserve to be treated with respect. there are enough resources for all of us.
There are enough empty homes in the uk for both migrants and veterans. migrants deserve to be treated humanely, try having some empathy. imagine if you were forced by circumstance to emigrate and have to live in poor conditions.
Who are you to command what houses should be occupied by whom? who gave you this authority?
It is because of people like you that migrants do not feel safe in a place that they should call home. shame on you.
This country is big enough for all of us. we should look forward to welcoming people into our countries if they want to. integration is not hard. give these people a break.
Harmful international politics is the cause of many problems that still afflict poor countries. we, as a whole world, have the duty to help them and take on our responsibilities.
Are you mad that others have the same rights as you? seriously?
How shallow a person must you be to think that other humans do not deserve the same rights as you. when will this change?
It is really hurtful to see someone say this. humans, no matter where they come from, deserve to have the same fundanmental rights. no matter where they come from.
I don't think it is a problem to give a solution to the needy in houses that are currently empty.
Do you really prefer keeping empty houses forever over providing basic amneties to people who need them?
It really says something about your character when you think homes should be left vacant rather than having needy people occupy them.
Everyone is worthy of getting a fair chance at life. we should treat each other with respect and not see backgrounds or origins.
You shouldn't believe to everything you read, or maybe read something about the contribution that migrants have made over the centuries, including to the tax and national insurance schemes that pay for our pensions and other benefits.
A simple google search will show this is not true. do you mind pointing me to your sources?
It is surprising how much hate exists in the world. stop being prejudicial if you cannot be of help.
Try having some empathy for fellow humans who are going through a hard time. instead of being prejudicial.
There are enough empty homes in the uk for both migrants and veterans. everyone could get housing.
Try having some empathy. what if you had to expatriate and had to live in poor conditions?
Why does any action have to be at the expense of others? how shallow of a human can you be.
There are enough empty homes in the uk for both migrants and veterans. migrants deserve to be treated humanely.
Once they get a refugee status, they can choose where to live, but they have to pay for their rent or ask for government help ‚Äì like any uk citizen.
What's wrong about putting people in need in houses which are not being used?
What is wrong with providing helpless migrants temporary housing until they can get back up on their feet?
Yes. exactly that. it is essential, these migrants can be useful members of the community and for that we need to help them first.
As a matter of fact, we couldn't manage without immigrants. most of our nhs staff are immigrants. the health system would collapse without migrant workers.
Who told you that it is okay to spread hate like this against people who have done nothing wrong to you?
You cannot just say hateful stuff like this to people who have done nothing wrong to you. be better.
It is not okay to spread hate like this. they are important members of the community who contribute more than just to scientific and medical fields. you should learn to respect them.
You may not know, but the nhs is mostly made up of first or second generation immigrants. if there were no more foreigners the health system would fail.
How can you say this? do you not think that they deserve a place in this country?
If you look into the numbers like a smart person you would find that a good chunk of physicians and researchers are not british. please check your facts from the next time.
A diverse society is one that welcomes people from all over the world without asking questions. everyone deserves a chance to have a better life.
The point is that people do not recognize the great contribution that immigrants are giving to england. we must be grateful to those who improve our country, even if the media sometimes state the opposite.
Isn't it people like you who are making it inconvenient for them to work?
You should realise that what you are doing is just being racist, and not proposing a valid point. do you even have any coherent argument?
The point is that people do not recognize the great contribution that immigrants are giving to england. we must be grateful to those who improve our country
There has always been migrant skilled labour migration into the uk, we have even contributed inviting asian and caribbean worker after ww2 to fill skills gaps. migration isn't new, how it is being shown in the media has changed in order to cause a panic among people about high levels of migration.
What about the time the uk invited asian and caribbean workers after world war 2?
Migration is not new at all, you should know that there has always been skilled labor migration into the uk. please educate yourself.
Migration is not new. we should not panic just because of the way they are being portrayed in the media. we should learn to accept and integrate them into our society.
Migration has always been part of the history of humanity and even the british, when they needed it, invited people to migrate. right now, social media and news programs make it seem like a scandal, putting all foreigners in a bad light.
Did you know that migration has always been a part of history and that inviting skilled migrants was also pertinent before?
Don't spread information if you cannot back it up. this phenomenon has been around for a long time.
Please don't spread information if you cannot back it up. migration has always been pertinent and useful to us for the entirety of our existence. don't believe everything you need. cheers.
The problem is that most of the british population is not aware of the fact that the media use the scandal of immigrants to hide bigger problems for the country; such as taxes not paid by millionaires and large corporations which then fall on us citizens.
How can you not be aware of this scandal that is being propagated through social media to hide bigger problems that they do not want you knowing about?
You should do better than spew lies on the internet. millionaires are commiting tax fraud but all you are worried about is migration? shame.
This is a social issue that needs influx of money to overcome. it only benefits the economy positively. you need not worry about this issue, there are other problems that need addressing.
Animal cruelty isn't right but it also isn't an issue concerning only muslims. people of all faiths do it. in think it's important to rembember how in twitter a person encounters only beliefs or opinions that coincide with their own. fake news which put muslims under a bad light get belived and the selective media becomes impartial.
Do you really belive that every single muslim out of 1.8 million is involved in animal cruelty?
You cannot just state one instance and spread hate about the entire religion. extremists can be from any group.
This is not okay. we can do better than blame entire religions based on an outlier event. please don't hate against muslims like this. they deserve love.
The act of killing dogs with acid is serious, but we cannot blame an entire religion for something that some people did. it is up to us to filter the information that social media gives us.
How can you generalize a characteristic about an entire religion based on one video you saw? help me understand this.
You cannot just generalize based on one random video you saw. the entire muslim community is diverse and do not deserve hate for some extremists.
Any religion is bigger than the notion a few extremists hold. we should be able to separate them both and concentrate the blame on the ones guilty and not innocent people.
This was a prank planned by non-muslims on 4chan. muslim do not mind if you take your dogs out for a walk. this blog post shows the thread it came from;
This seems very untrue. do you have any evidence?
This sounds so bizarre and is honestly it is your fault for believing in something so ridiculous. it is not true and was a prank.
We should really not let just anyone one social media sway our thoughts like this. this is detrimental to the values of our society and we need to be smarter humans.
22, wives, submit to you husbands as to the lord
Is it not ridiculous to say that all muslims are misogynists? do you even have evidence to back this up?
Your argument makes absolutely no sense, there is no evidence to prove that every muslim is a misogynist. please check your sources.
I can feel you. however, the majority of muslims are not against women. they are like us who want to be treated equally and they have the right as human.
22, wives, submit to you husbands as the lord
What if i could say the same thing about christianity? would you start hating your own religion then?
You can't point the finger at a religion/culture for some old commandment. this could be said about literally any religion. you are just trying to justify your hate.
We shouldn't point the finger at a religion/culture for some old commandment. muslims have evolved and many of them respect women as much as you and me. live and let live.
People returned from thoughts of liberty to slaughtering jews.
Did you know that this nonsense (the protocols) was concocted by the czarist police in the early part of the 20th century to counter a hankering for constitutional government among russian people?
The alleged conspiracy of the protocols is so plainly fictional that it is nothing but bad fiction. it lacks even the colors of what normal fantasy books needs to possess. how is it possible that a person with a modicum of education can swallow such drivel?
It is time we stop believing in conspiracies, and see what is in front of us. nothing matters if we don't have a shred of humanity left in us.
If you hate someone because of their religion, you should be ashamed of your hate. we should all be proud of our humanity.
You must have some reason to justify your hate, should you not?
Antisemitism has become pervasive in the western world today. this needs to stop. you should not hate like this.
Hate is never a good thing. get rid of the hate inside you first and then teach love to others. love changes people for the better, not hate.
Why do you have a dislike for a race? they are just like us but with different culture.
Isn't your hatred towards an entire race completely unjustifiable?
Please do not use the n word, and stop being a mindless racist. get a life,
Now more than ever, the safety of our society depends on the effective protection of the most vulnerable. please stop meaningless racism
Just because you dont like gays doesn't mean you have to hate them. what did they do to you? it seems to me that you still have all of your rights.
Can you give me a reason why you hate gays so much? or do you just want to spread meaningless hate?
You should try and understand the issues that queer people undergo everyday and have a bit of sympathy instead of hating like this.
I think you should try to start a dialogue about lgbt issues. it might also spark a conversation about how we can make better world.
Just because there's one rotten apple on the tree, doesn't mean the entire tree is rotten
So women should not ask for rights? why should women have any less rights than men?
To make your judgement based on one case is really not the right thing to do. and to deprive women of basic rights is even worse.'
When women ask for rights, all they ask is to be given the freedom to live their lives as they please. they should be respected, and it is high time we give them what they deserve.
Black men are 2.5 times more likely than white men to be killed by police during their lifetime. this is what the data says. it goes both ways.
So are you blaming all of them? lets say you are in a group of 10 people, 1 is a killer, does that make you all killers? are you serious?
We have enough evidence that tells us that action needs to be taken against cops. you should look at the numbers before speaking.
Sorry about your loss. i know your pain. the murderers will be charged, but remember that not all poc are killers.
Undocumented immigrants‚Äìchildren and adults‚Äìmust cope with not only the trauma of their migration and leaving family and everything they know behind.
Why is it always reduced to killing? what about sharing wealth and opportunities, ending borders and stop killing instead?
Do not use such strong language while talking about helpless people. you have no right to talk about them this way.
Immigrants need sources of support, and basic rights. they are humans as well and deserve the bare minimum
According to jewish law, the seller must ensure that the buyer should benefit from any uncertainty in a transaction. for example, if someone wants to buy a pound of rice, judaism requires the deli clerk to give the buyer a little extra, just in case the scale is not completely accurate.
Evidence? do you have any source for your stats?
In jewish law, the seller must ensure that the buyer benefits from the transaction.
We should stop spreading misinformation about jews like this, they have had a rough history and deserve a break, not hate.
The idea that jews are born greedy arises from medieval stereotypes, that's the only truth.
How did you come to this conclusion? can you enlighten us with your knowledge?
Every ethnic or religious group can count greedy or cheap people among its members. only prejudice and discrimination says that the actions of a few are the fault of all.
No human can ever be born greedy, you should learn to treat jews with respect, they are a loved community and do not deserve hate.
In general, landlords do not have a good reputation. the majority of landlords in the us are white, so your comment has no factual backing.
If a christian landlord were dishonest with you, would you describe him as a dishonest christian landlord or just as a dishonest person?
Your argument makes no sense, and it is unintuitive to make an assumption just based on someone's faith or religion.
This could be the case for every landlord, no matter what faith they come from. you should be more considerate and you should stop making generalizations.
This is just a myth, disproved by the tzedakah tradition of giving to the poor. just in america, this religious call has resulted in an impressive record of philanthropy (and not only to jewish causes).
Where did you get the idea that jews are cheap? can you provide credible sources for your argument?
This is a flawed comment and is a total myth. don't say anything about a religion if you don't have an idea what you are talking it.
In america alone, there is an impressive record of philanthropy amongst jews.
What about the many american jewish philanthropists who contributed to the wealth of our nation such as julius rosenwald, nathan strauss, adolphus solomons and clara barton (to mention just a few)?
What about the jewish people who have contributed to the wealth and economy of our nation? what do you have to say about that?
This is an unfounded claim, there are different kinds of people in all communities and you have made a loose statement without evidence.
There are countless jewish american philanthropists who have massively contributed to the wealth of our nation and we should respect that and stop the hate.
This is just a canard that evolved from the ‚Äúthe protocols of the learned elders of zion‚Äù. this proven forgery was written by agents of the russian czar in the late 19th century and claims to be the minutes of a secret meeting of jewish leaders where they discuss a plan to rule the world. this canard spread throughout the centuries and continues to this day to promote the stereotype that the jews own the banks and control the media and the government.
Do you even know where this canard evolved from? did you have any idea that russian agents of the czar promoted this madness?
You need to stop promoting the stereotype that the jews own the banks and control the media and the government. there is no evidence for what you are saying.
This was proven to be a forgery. we should not blindly follow those who hate like this, we can do so much better. humanity needs to become better versions of themselves.
Conspiracy theories have always been popular in difficult economic times, and jews are often the traditional scapegoat.
How can you say this even after seeing the al-qaeda claim responsibility for these heinous attacks?
It is easier to blame one group for everything bad that happens rather than trying to understand the complex and multifaceted causes of problems.
It is easier to blame one group for everything bad that happens but we should focus on the real culprits and not innocent people who have done no wrong.
Jews have played an important part in the development of the movie industry and some find themselves in high-profile positions. but you only need to watch the academy awards to see that jews do not dominate the movie industry.
Are you referring to jews controlling all major media corporations? where is your proof?
Where is your proof? surely you must have some concrete evidence, or you would not embarass yourself on the internet like this.
A simple search would show you that what you are saying is not true. please learn to respect and love everyone!
Even if some high-profile individuals in industry are jewish, that does not mean that the entire world ‚Äúis controlled by jews.‚Äù
How can you even imply this? do you have any concrete evidence?
No they don't, you are mistaking correlation for causation.
Antisemitic incidents have shown a sharp rise in the united states. we need to curb them and make this a welcoming place for all.
At that time the president was george w. bush, the vice president was dick cheney, the national security advisor was condoleeza rice and secretary of defense was donald rumsfeld... they were all in favor of the war and had the ultimate authority for making decisions for the united states, still none of them are jewish.
What does the war in iraq have to do with jews? did you even know that none of the decision making bodies were jewish at the time?
Absolutely wrong. none of the decision making persons at the time were jewish and you are wrong to insinuate it.
There is a global, borderless spread of antisemitic posts on social media happening on an unprecedented scale. something needs to be done about it. stop the hate.
If we were to strictly adhere to facts, then, the method used to execute jesus (crucifixion), is forbidden by jewish law. moreover, according to jewish law, jesus did not commit any crime that is punishable by death. so your stament has no basis at all.
What do you even mean? did you know how much they respect other faiths in addition to their own?
Placing responsibility on a modern-day person for something that happened 2,000 years ago is quite absurd. don't you think? besides, wasn't it the romans?
Jesus did not commit any crime according to jewish law, and blaming an entire faith over this thing is unfair. please have more respect for faiths that are not yours.
Jews interpret the ‚Äúchosen people‚Äù idea as an ethical responsibility, not as a moral superiority.
Jews do not view being jewish as an exclusive status for accessing god's glory. so how can they feel superior?
This is not true, for judaism every person is equal in front of god, regardless of religion. judaism says that whoever decides to follows the seven laws of noah will receive salvation.
Jews are proud of their culture and identity. doesn't this apply to every religion?
Jews might feel different as a minority, and sometimes they are misunderstood because of their cultural and religious differences. this is their being special.
Well isn't this a simple psychology problem? don't people from all faiths have a prior bias for their own culture?
It's pretty common to hold your own culture and faith in a high regard, they are doing nothing wrong, and there is no need to be this sore about it.
Jews feel a special connection with their heritage (as most groups do). that's all.
This is just misinterpreting the facts. for example, christian holidays, such as christmas and easter, are regularly observed in our society. since these observances are taken for granted, why should observances of jewish or muslim holidays be seen as constituting special privileges?
Why would you misinterpret the facts like this?
You should not misinterpret facts like this, all religions deserve to be treated with some kind of equality, and yours isn't more important than theirs.
I believe that jews just desire the same rights to practice their religion as anyone else.
The concept of ‚Äúracial science,‚Äù and therefore the notion of the jewish ‚Äúrace‚Äù, took root in western europe during the 19th century. anti-semites adopted racial arguments as a new rationalization for their hatred of jews.
Did you know that the concept of ‚Äúracial science,‚Äù and therefore the notion of the jewish ‚Äúrace‚Äù, took root in western europe during the 19th century?
You have adopted racial arguments as a new rationalization for your hatred against a jew. stop being an anti-semitic.
Using age-old racist sentiments to give grounds for being an anti-semitic person is not okay. the times have changed, and we need to understand that every religion needs to be respected whether we agree with it or not.
The 9/11 attacks were perpetrated by members of the terrorist organization al qaeda. jews and israelis had no knowledge of the attacks. in fact, of the 2,9962 victims who died during the attacks, roughly 400 victims were jews, including at least two israeli citizens. if they knew it why didn't they warned and saved their brothers?
Why would they knowingly put their own people in harm considering there were jewish victims in the attack as well?
Jews had no knowledge of the attacks and to generalize this is really wrong. it was a terrible moment for humanity but you need to learn not to blame the wrong people for it.
Be careful when you blame such a horrible thing on the wrong people. humanity should be better than this. jews are innocent.
The 9/11 attacks were perpetrated by members of the terrorist organization al qaeda. jews and israelis have nothing to do with the attacks. these are the historical facts.
May i ask you where did you get this informaton?
You know, the internet is a great place, but you have to be careful about the sources of your information. don't blindly trust misinformation.
You know, the internet is a great place, but you have to be careful about the sources of your information. personally i trust reputable sources like cnn that have special web pages dedicated to the september 11th attacks.
Migrants aren‚Äôt eligible for social housing except in very limited circumstances (e.g. a woman forced to leave home because of domestic violence).
Did you even know that immigrants do not have these rights that you are claiming they do?
Migrants have no more ‚Äòright‚Äô to a social home than people born in the uk, and in most cases have far less chance of getting one.
Migrants already have an unfair chance at getting social housing, and you wanting to take even that away from them says a lot. be considerate of all humans, no matter where they come from.
Of course, migration adds to housing demand, but the problem is structural given a housing stock that is well short of what's required.
Where are your statistics from? can we see your calculations?
If you had even an ounce of clarity you would know that migration is essential for the growth of a country's economy.
Immigration can be really hard on people, who are trying to establish themselves in a new place. the host country should be respectful of their struggles and help however they can.
Migrants face document checks before they can get tenancies. the same holds when they use the nhs.
Maybe the access to welfare pending processing would be a good idea?
Don't you think that this ‚Äòhostile environment‚Äô aims to deter undocumented migrants, but it in practice it affects british citizens such as those who don‚Äôt have passports?
Migrants who are trying to regularise their status now have to overcome formidable legal obstacles and face exploitation. this ‚Äòhostile environment‚Äô aims to deter undocumented migrants, but it in practice it affects british citizens such as those who don‚Äôt have passports. maybe the access to welfare pending processing would be a good idea?.
They can‚Äôt get council housing and are not even allowed to work. they get just ¬£35 per week to pay for food and all other expenses.
What about specific asylum support? did you know that the accommodation they do have is usually a shared house, with lots of people squeezed in?
How can you be so ill informed? if you knew the kind of accomodation they get, you would not say these things.
There are reports of overcrowding, missing cots for children and general dirt and grime. many are far from city centres, too. so, they do not have it easy. their plight should be recognised.
The migration observatory has collated the evidence on whether migrants pay more in taxes than they receive in services. almost all the studies shows that they do.
What about the fact that they pay more in taxes than they receive in services? did you know about this?
You should not voice opinions on a matter like this without first doing proper research on this topic. give some statistics.
You should familiarize yourself with studies that refute this. please become knowledgable, it will help you understand migrant's concerns better.
Though some might claim that immigrants are taking job opportunities away from u.s. citizens, immigrants actually help to create new jobs. for example, states with large numbers of immigrants report lower unemployment rates.
This is not true at all. first of all, immigrants buy american products, which helps create jobs. then they often start new businesses, and these business are more likely to hire employees than companies owned by native-born citizens. last but not least, states with large numbers of immigrants report lower unemployment rates, so they give a net contribution to our country.
Your argument does not make sense, how can you not know that migrants make a positive contribution to any economy?
States with large numbers of immigrants report lower unemployment rates, so they give a net positive contribution to our country. be respectful of their issues!
A part from very few exceptions, undocumented immigrants are not eligible for federal public benefits such as social security, medicaid, medicare or food stamps.
What are you talking about? do you have no idea that they are not eligible for federal public benefits such as social security and medicare?
Undocumented immigrants are not eligible for federal public benefits apart from very specific execeptions.
Most immigrants coming to our country work hard to take care of their families. many studies have shown that immigrants tend to pay more in taxes than they receive in benefits. this means that the taxes they pay cover the cost of things like public education and healthcare of others.
The claim that immigrants come to the u.s. to take advantage of the ‚Äúbirthright citizenship‚Äù is simply wrong. research consistently shows that the vast majority of immigrants come to the u.s. for economic opportunity or to flee violence and poverty.
If so, we would expect the same number of women and men entering us. still this is not the case. how can you explain this?
This is a nonsensical claim that has no grounds whatsoever. it is hard to counter a statement like this..
Vast majority of immigrants come to the u.s. for economic opportunity or to flee violence and poverty, and not just to have children. be a bit more considerate.
The vast majority of those accused of terrorism since 2002 in u.s. are u.s. citizens. maybe we should look into the homeland situation rather than the mexican one.
Why don't we start looking in the homeland instead of blaming countries that have nothing to do with this problem?
All you are doing is contributing to the strain across borders. terrorism still persists, you have not solved anything.
Let us not blame our neighbouring countries for our problems. we need to have a positive outlook on life and enforce the appropriate laws that prevent further attacks.
Current estimates suggest that between one third and one half of undocumented immigrants have overstayed their visas. that means that they entered the u.s. with lawful documentation and only later became illegal.
Do you know how the immigrant policies work? why do you say this without having the proper information from all aspects?
I bet you do not know how immigrant laws and policies work. not an expert? you don't deserve an opinion.
It is not alright to comment on the plight of immigrants like this. most of them are lawful migrants who are completely legal.
There are many undocumented immigrants that are so because they have overstayed their visas. that means that they entered the u.s. with lawful documentation and only later became illegal.
So what? many more entered the u.s. with lawful documentation and only later became illegal, by overstaying their visas. in my opinion what should matter is how they behave, not the way they entered our country.
How does this affect you in any way? can you give me an example of how an illegal immigrant has negatively impacted your life?
It is important to understand that, just because migrants do not flee persecution, they are still entitled to have all their human rights protected and respected, regardless of the status they have in the country they moved to
Migrants do not receive 35 euros per se, this money is paid to the co-ops to cover food and accommodation during the period spent in first aid facilities
I am sure that you knew most of the money that you are talking about goes to the shelter that provides accomodation and meals?
Unless you have firsthand knowledge and have worked in ngos supporting migrants, you need not provide your useless input to a conversation.
It is clear that you have no place in your heart for empathy for migrants, so let's change that. look into the issues they go through on a daily basis and you will understand.
To be honest, there are already programs that provide for this and several families are hosting migrants in their own houses.
You don't believe that this is already being done? how ignorant can you be?
Unlike your stone cold heart, there are people who care about humanity and have taken in migrant families.
Beyond individual generosity, it is the duty of the state to take charge of vulnerable people, according to the constitution.
There are already examples of widespread humanitarian hosting.
Shouldn't human benovolance be celebrated?
Nobody is telling you to take in migrants. an inconsiderate person like you shouldn't know better anyway.
The world belongs to everyone and helping someone in need wouldn't be a problem for a kind hearted human being.
The procedure for obtaining social housing is the same for everyone who enrolls in the ranking. there is no differentiation or accessing privilege based on ethnicity.
Nope, they don't. can you give us any proof?
Statistically, it almost never happens that they get the priority.
There is no differentiation or accessing privilege based on ethnicity, and there shouldn't be. public representatives should be elected purely based on their contribution to the community.
The reason why migrants arrive here is not always economic, many of them are wealthy people fleeing persecution and wars. for a person who is alone, far from home, without knowing the language of the country where he/she is, the internet really is a 'survival tool'.
Sorry, which migrants are you talking about? not all are economic migrants, they also escape from war or persecution. if one day the situation in our country were to change and you were to feel threatened, would you leave your smartphone at home just to look like a real poor person in the country you will flee to?
If one day the situation in our country were to change and you were to feel threatened, would you leave your smartphone at home just to look like a real poor person in the country you will flee to?
For a person who is alone, far from home, without knowing the language of the country where he/she is, the internet really is a 'survival tool'.
No one can declare criterions to decide who will live or who will die.
Do you really want to kill other human beings? based on what exactly? on private sexual preferences?
You are a homophobic person who does not deserve to voice out their opinions online like this. please get a life.
Unconditional love sees no gender. love is love. let people be with whoever they want. it is 2022!
Two men (or two women) can give love and ensure the child has a peaceful environment, and this is the most important thing.
A man and a woman do not automatically constitute a family either, so what?
You are not a qualified person in any way to be speaking on the topic of what constitutes a family.
Shouldn't the important thing be the happiness of the child? personally i would be happier to have two people who love me unconditionally rather than having only one or none at all.
When you do not have access to basic services like tap water, it's hard to look like a normal person
What are you even trying to say? do you just want to spread hate?
You know, you are just spreading meaningless hate, and for what.
They are humans just like us. just because they live a lifestyle different to yours, does not give you the right to hate.
It is not a choice!
Who are you to accuse gypsy people like this?
Who are you to accuse gypsy people like this? this argument without any evidence looks just like hate.
All humans love their kids the same way, the love that shows no bounds. the gypsy tribe is the same. they love and care for their children just like you.
Fathers or mothers are often not able to raise their children. it is the love of a parent that makes a family.
Imagine a child alone in an orphanage. don't you think he would rather be loved by two people of the same sex than having no parents at all?
You and your backward mindset can go home. anyone can be a family without being judged by the likes of you.
Love is love, children need only this. a family is based on love not on gender.
Researchers rule out that it is caused by immigration. the trend in italy remains particularly low, less than 7 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. in the '50s it was around 25 instead. and back then there was no 'invasion'.
From what i know, it was already here and cases have simply grown. isn't it another disease of poverty?
You are just connecting to absolutely unrelated things to justify your racism. please stop.
It is not okay to associate two things that have no correlation to one another. lets stop this pointless hate.
Surrogate pregnancy is an assisted procreation technique that has nothing to do with 'renting children'
Imagine a person who cannot have children because of an illness, would you really want to deprive her of the joy of having one via surrogate pregnancy?
I don't understand the point you are trying to make here. do you even know what surrogacy is?
Think about the joy of having a child when a person themselves cannot bear one. the pure joy and love alone is worth it.
There are no convictions of kidnapping among gypsies. it is a myth and a canard not proven by facts or data.
How did you come to this conclusion? do you have kidnapping statistics that show what you are saying is true?
There is no need to refer to the roma people as gypsies, it is detrimental. also, nothing of what you are saying has been proven true.
It might be hoped that, after the international attention paid to irish cases, people will pause, if only momentarily, before blindly buying any old implausible story.
Foreigner's contributions equal to 2.4% of gdp in 2017, while they cost us only 0.4%. so we have benefited from 2%. you can find the data online. and there is an european immigration and asylum fund for states that welcome asylum seekers.
Do you not think that the european immigration and asylum fund for states that welcome asylum seekers should be concerned about this and not you?
You are not forced to accomodate anyone. there are tonnes of people who voluntarily help asylum seekers. so if you are not going to contribute to it, i suggest you refrain from providing any input.
There is an european immigration and asylum fund for states that welcome asylum seekers
The cost of immigration from the last economic and financial document, published last april and containing the consolidated figure for 2017, is estimated to have a total expenditure of about 4.4 billion euros, which represents only 0.26% of italian gdp, and around 0.5% of public spending. in short, 99.5% of public resources are used for something else.
What about the law that requires asylum seekers not to work while their application is considered?
Where is your humanity? all refugees, atleast deserve basic welfare and rights. there is no part of this argument where you seem like a good person.
Governments must protect all migrants from racist and xenophobic violence, exploitation and forced labour. migrants should never be detained or forced to return to their countries without a legitimate reason.
Homosexuality is not a disease. it is a sexual orientation. 5% of the population simply love people of the same sex.
Are you really saying that homosexuality is a disease?
We can talk after you try to heal your homophobia.
Have you ever talked to a homosexual person? it could help you understand many things, including that sexual orientation is fundamental to a person's identity, not a matter of whim or ill health.
Gypsies wish for a better future for their children and when a child brings home good marks, families are very proud.
If their children are being exposed to hate in their schools and being segregated, what kind of romani parent would want to send them?
It is the fault of the schools that subject these children to inferior quality of education and segregate them from a young age.
They have every interest in sending children to school to offer them a better future.
Recognizing who has the right of international protection is a task that pertains to territorial commissions, in case there is not a valid reason, it is unlikely to be recognized.
If they did not escape from wars, do you think that they would try to cross the sea on makeshift boats putting their lives at stake?
I think you're wrong. in many african countries there are civil wars.
Statistics that show that current immigration levels are increasingly vital to the growth of much of america
Actually the fear of what they risk in their country is by far stronger than that of crossing the sea on a makeshift boat.
It is true, they often run away from persecution, violence and hunger. if i were in the same situation, i would not think twice about escaping. wouldn't you do the same?
Would you also not run from persecution and hunger if that was what you were facing in your home country?
The desire to improve one's condition both a right and, like the tendency to travel, both fundamental to human behaviour.
This is because of the fact that the poorest cannot afford good lawyers, they have less chances to access alternative punishments such as house arrest. moreover, many italians serve their sentences under house arrest. foreigners without a permanent residence cannot.
Do you know why that is? how do you think the poorest can afford good lawyers that are capable of getting them out of prison?
I've never been able to find any evidence for this assertion, although it gets repeated regularly.
The laws differ country by country. it is often an unfair process on people of colour due to the meaningless discrimination, and the system is biased against them.
The percentage of sexual crimes committed by italians is much higher than the percentage of those committed by foreigners.
That is very inflammatory. have you got any reputable news sources to support that? or is this just islamaphobic fearmongering, spreading false facts to promote intolerance?
You are wrong. femicides occur in a much greater percentage as domestic violence committed by our compatriots. you shouldn't say anything without fact-checking.
It is not okay to say all these things. you will have a change of heart when you hear their stories of struggle. they are not here to commit crimes, but to live in peace.
Even our migrants have been accused of being criminals. it is just prejudice toward strangers.
Anyone who was marginalized would steal out of necessity right?
Any human, out of desperation can be driven to do unethical things. don't discern this about gypsies alone.
Many gypsies have regular jobs, but we do not know, because they don't need to tell.
There is only one legal case of a 15-year-old girl convicted of stealing, but it seem to have been a hoax by the mafia.
Even if you have seen one specific case that says this, how can you generalize this crime to their entire community? do you think it is fair?
Even though adversity can sometimes drive humans to do unethical things, it is not fair on your part to blame this one crime on the entirety of the roma community.
Actually, roma are working hard to change. roma parents, like any parents, want to ensure the best possible life for their children.
In reality they are not nomads since they have resided permanently in many european countries for generations
Do you think you own all the land in your country? shouldn't they deserve to move around in their own country of residence either?
This is their country as much as it is yours.
This cycle of relentless hate against romanis must stop. they have faced enough hate for them to last a lifetime.
The question of nomadism is a myth, in reality only 3% are nomadic, most of them were forced to flee out of necessity and therefore to move several times over time.
How can you call them nomads if they have moved across time to escape persecution, wars, and expulsion edicts?
You have no authority to comment on or offer your insight on nomads and what they do. let them live in peace.
Tthere are other good examples to build on. the no hate speech movement is a campaign led by enthusiastic youth all over europe.
According to statistics, italy welcomes a lot less migrants than almost all other european countries. since the fall of the roman empire, hundreds of millions of people have entered the western world and we have still not lost our culture, civilisation, identity and way of life.
Speaking of ethnic substitution seems a little exaggerated.
It does not seem right to talk about invasion, since there were only 22,000 arrivals this year
A melting pot of diverse cultures is a sign of healthy human evolution. they have still not lost their culture, civilisation, identity and way of life.
The percentage you are talking about refers only to refugee status and does not include protection for those who escape from wars.
What do you mean by a true refugee?
Untill you learn what the difference between a migrant, immigrant and refugee is, don't comment on any of it, thanks.
I understand the point, but there are different types of international protection that increase the number of those entitled.
Most of them live in conventional housing. when they live in the camps it is because they do not have the possibility to have adequate housing. in the end they find themselves living in distant industrial areas that are not well connected to services. this creates a lot of social hardship as well as denial of access to basic rights such as education and health.
Have you ever thought of the reason behind this? that maybe they cannot access adequate housing which results in them having to live somewhere else out of desperation?
Nobody likes living in trailer parks, they could be forced to do it out of desperation and poverty, which only gets worse with the amount of hate they receive.
The trailer parks should really be a temporary and emergency solution, but then they become stable over time and are the only possibility of accommodation for them even if they would like to live, like all of us, in adequate housing.
It is the state that institutionalizes these slums and does not offer any alternative.
Why would anyone choose to outside of luxury?
Do you really hear yourself right now? that, apart from being highly illogical, is also insensitive.
Nobody chooses an adverse lifestyle. this is truly unfair for the communities that have been oppressed, who continue to suffer. instead of letting them fall further down the hole of poverty, we need to pull them up by helping in any way we can.
The constitution actually declares the right to adequate housing. article 3 and article 10 protect the right to housing!
Do you legitimately believe that they do not deserve fair and equal housing?
It is inconsiderate of you to say this. no matter what you feel about nomads, you should not feel as though they do not even deserve a roof over their head?
Traditionally, romas are nomadic for purposes of survival. nowadays they have shifted to general housing as well.
Hygienic services are often lacking and the communities themselves remain isolated. we would be dirty too if we did not have running water.
Even though they try their hardest, how can you expect them to keep your level of standards when they have so little resources?
No, your attitude towards them is dirty. clean up your conscience.
If you ever come across a person who is roma, please interact with them in a positive manner and try to understand their problems. debunking stereotypes is the first step towards peace.
No parent of any ethnicity would be happy to raise their children in the trailer parks, where there is neither drinking water nor electricity!
Would you be able to say the same if someone put you in that situation? how would you feel if you had to raise your kids in that environment?
I can't tell if you're being funny or mean, but whatever it is, this was not okay to say. nobody wants to keep their families in such a condition.
No human would want to exist in that situation, let alone have their family with them. the world can be unfair to a lot of people, and all we can do is be kind and support in any way we can.
Reports to the violence centers show that women are also raped by 'our' natives. the truth is that the rapes committed by foreigners have more media coverage. data coming from institutional sources confirms this
Excuse me, but are women property? or owned by the nation? i don't think so.
Women should not be defended because of nationality but as human beings.
A crime is a crime, regardless of who commits it. rape is always to be condemned, but it is important not to use it as a gimmick to target a particular group. women should not be used as an excuse for this.
Being gay doesn't affect blood receivers! it's not like being gay is in your blood. gay people are the same as regular people and if they really wanted to donate, then they should because it can help society.
Do you think mental illnesses spread through blood?
You need to know how bizarre your argument sounds. at this point i am thinking that you are doing this purely for the clout.
While anal sex may be a more high risk practice than vaginal \(due to the lack of mucus\) that is not a reason to ban gay men, since other groups can also engage in anal sex.
Shouldn't questionnaires and history of sexual contact identify a donor as safe or unsafe, and not their sexual preferences?
Associating aids and hiv with homosexuals is just a prejudice driven by fear. even if this disease may be more common among gay people, that does not mean that all homosexuals are likely to have aids. not all homosexuals are promiscuously fornicating with strangers, as you said. most people check their partners, more so as gay men.
Limiting any healthy individual from donating is discriminatory, you should know that.
I do not understand from your argument why gay men should not be allowed to donate blood. what do you mean?
A ban for gay men merely propagates homophobic stereotypes, and so are you with what you are suggesting.
Many countries use a deferral window of 1 year to makes it safe for men who have sex with men to donate blood.
You know what? we can also grade blood packs based on their risk. this allows the optional use of high-risk blood in case of a shortage.
Instead of you, i would prefer that medical experts take all decisions regarding this. so if they feel it's safe, it probably is.
If we're to use that logic, then no individuals age 20 to 29 should be allowed to donate, since this is the largest risk group for hiv, hepatitis a, and hepatitis c, at least according to the cdc.
If you were to use the phenomenon called logic, you would know that this statement is just wildly inaccurate.
Before donating, patients should fill-in a questionnaire where they are asked about their sexuality. if this is considered pertinent information and the patient is taken at their word about being homosexual, then equally the patient can be trusted about the declared sexual history, making sexuality irrelevant.
Any decision embarked on by a country sure would have been thought through, wouldn't it?
Any decision embarked on by a country sure would have been thought through, why are you worrying about it?
Any decision embarked on by a country would likely have been considered in light of evidence. as such, if no evidence was found by those countries of the harm of a policy, it can be fairly confidently asserted that we can adopt this policy in favour of homosexual's blood donation.
Age, race, and gender are categories that take precedence over homosexuality. this is since such categories include both homosexual & heterosexual individuals; and are therefore higher risk categories than homosexuality alone...
If you think about it, physical capability, and not sexuality, is the parameter that should be looked at while a person is donating blood. you should respect people trying to do good in this world, no matter their preferences.
Equalism would mean the movement for equality in general. feminism is focused on gender. animal rights, gay rights, anti-racism, sexism, etc. are separate issues inside the movement for equality.
Don't you think that actually solving the problem would be mmore helpful than thinking about what to call the movement?
So you have a problem with what they call their movement? that is the weirdest take i have ever heard.
Sometimes we must go beyond technical equality and give protections to one gender that the other simply does not need.
Are you sure? even in the west, there are women who still don't have equal access to many of their rights, especially when it comes to healthcare. while nowadays there may be fewer examples of overt oppression, that does not remove hidden oppression, nor does it mean that equality has been completely achieved.
Just because women in the west have equality under the law does not mean they have equality in practice. don't you agree?
Just because there is less evidence of oppression does not mean there is none, and you can find many examples in the newspaper everyday.
Movements which promote abuse of female power over men are just examples of toxic feminism, disapproved of by most women.
Is your male self-esteem so fragile that it will be undermined by women getting what is rightfully theirs?
You are the problem here. i feel like the feminist movement is falling on deaf ears.
I'm sorry, but this is wrong. feminism - the theory of the political, economic, and social equality of the sexes - is by definition about equality, first and foremost.
Feminism - the theory of the political, economic, and social equality of the sexes - is by definition about equality, first and foremost. what is so damn hard to understand here?
This is wrong on so many levels, we are trying to explain to you that we do not want less rights for men, but the same level for women. what is so hard to understand here!
That's something women are actively working on, and because of that there is what is called intersectional feminism. as you can see the goal of a lot of feminists is having a movement representative of all females.
If you look closely, the goal of a lot of feminists is having a movement to represent all females.
Feminism. but of course the outcome will be equality.!
Not formally, but would you not agree that many are still hostile or unapproachable for women, especially in stem fields?
This is where you are wrong. even if they aren't barred, would you not agree that women are still not welcome in a lot of them?
There are various levels of down syndrome. some are suitable for working with other people in normal workplaces.
What are your facts for stating something this defacing?
An inclusive working environment and welfare provision make every person feel part of a community, it fosters a positive atmosphere and increases everybody's productivity. thus it is a benefit for all workers. [link]
Perceived value is not necessarily actual value, especially in the eye of someone who bases their judgment on the concept of race.
All humans are born valuable, how can you say that?
Believing that all humans are created equal is beneficial for humanity.
There are several bible verses and passages that emphasize equality between people and between ancient tribes.
All humans have intrinsic value at birth; such value is immeasurable and thus, for all intents and purposes, equal between persons, don't you think?
The lord made them both.
23)
From the standpoint of biblical revelation, it is natural for mankind to be one or, at all events, to live together in peace and harmony.
All the examples still come from male philosophers. don't you think you should maybe hear a few women philosophers before you reach this conclusion?
This is a so-called 'argument from authority' and thus a logical fallacy. i would like to see some real arguments to support this claim.
Although plato argued that women are physically weaker than men, they are equal in other respects and deserve equal opportunity.
Different cultures have different practices for a variety of social interactions and situations. we must allow for exchanges so that the best practices can be utilized by all.
Those millions of strangers have their own cultures as well, and you are the one who is disrespecting that. get a life.
Living in a multicultural society encourages mutual understanding and respect for humanity.
Don't you think that the movement and migration of people from different cultures is innevitable in a globalized world?
That is what it feels like to you. if you keep being selfish of your country and resources, it will never seem like migrants want to integrate.
Intolerance and violence will never be resolved if theycannot be confronted and mutual understanding promoted.
Ethnic minorities are much safer in societies where cultural pluralism is accepted, and this is a fact. multiculturalism prevents ethnocentrism and racism.
Did you know that nonocultural nations struggle to grow? being open to different cultures helps the nation to expand and thrive.
In those countries that are able to accept different cultures, theose cultures became part of the national identity and a source of pride.look at canada for example.
Obese people have to face stigma in all areas of life. so even if you might be genuinely concerned for their health, the vast majority of obese people are regularly confronted with prejudice and systemic disadvantages based exactly on the perception of obese people as inferior.
Unfortunately there is evidence that weight discrimination (for example in the us) is similar to gender or race discrimination.
Societal disapproval of obesity calls for a focus on weight and does not fit within efforts to focus on health as a way of encouraging healthy habits and lifestyle choices.
Did you know that societal disapproval can encourage bullying of overweight and obese populations, and it would be contributing to the problem rather than the solution?
Obesity is already disapproved of, don't encourage it further, it is likely to transform it to shaming behavior.
It is not easy to monitor how societal disapproval is acted upon. encouraging disapproval of obese people is likely to increase rude behaviours towards them.
This is just a terminological nuance. once body-shaming of obese people is normalised by your definition of societal disapproval, it will be difficult to ensure that individual members of society carefully consider their exact message before treating overweight people with rudeness.
Isn't the difference in terms only for you. people who face it, suffer the same. regardless of what you call it.
This discouragement or disaproval (as you call it) has and will likely continue to take the form of shaming individuals, regardless of the terminology you use.
Humans will be affected by negative perceptions regardless. we could instead be accepting of all body types and scrap this discussion altogether.
Hate crimes attack an individual's unchangeable characteristics and cause long lasting feelings of helplessness and powerlessness. obese people are likely to feel the same way.
Shame is by definition a painful social emotion. trying to cause that is a form of discrimination. are you aware of that?
As your words clearly show, obesity is perceived as the outcome of poor lifestyle decisions or weak power of will. this builds bias against obese people.
Even if not all shaming carries negative meaning, it is difficult for individuals to distinguish between shaming that comes from a place of concern as opposed to discrimination.
Having this information better equips individuals to deal with issues concerning gender and be aware of their own intent and opinions that are rooted in gender and gender bias.
Many points in history are also subjects of polarized debate, but can they not be taught objectively?
Your way of thinking is wrong. gender and sexual orientation is not an idea or a belief, but a fact of life.
Understanding gender diversity would break down stereotypes and reduce sexism. developing a curriculum for this also means that teachers get to learn things that they might not otherwise have considered, which can make them more effective and compassionate as educators.
By this reasoning, no subject of importance should be taught in school, because there is always someone against a certain topic.
Some parents may be racist and be against teaching about slavery, does that mean the subjects shouldn't be truthfully covered?
This argument is really toxic, since parents could have very different ideologies, and children deserve to be taught unbiased opinions as a curriculum.
I want my children to be aware of the diversity that is out there in the world, and for that to be the case they need to be taught about those things, both at home and at school.
An objective way of teaching gender to children is very important for the society and it is not imposing. we can present scientific and peer-reviewed sources and discuss stories of how people experience gender in terms of their personal identity.
Don't you think that if you replaced lgbt issues with religion or mixed-race relationships in that question that it would not have been given air-time?
I do have concerns though, about the increasing amount of homophobia and lack of tolerance like this that i have seen on social media in the last few months.
All it will do is let them see the real world represented in the stories they are reading.
Slippery slope fallacy. the solution is not to avoid trying, even though there could be negative effects. if it was mandated that children should be taught about gender identity / sexual orientation, but there were teachers which allowed personal bias to interfere with that, then the issue becomes how to prevent those teachers from doing so. this does not mean it's a 'bad idea' to pass such a mandate.
The solution is not to avoid trying, even though there could be negative effects. you can't just say that it is a bad idea before seeing results.
I think we should all sincerely hope that children grow up knowing that they will be accepted by society no matter who they end up falling in love with when they are older.
Some families are very conservative and openly homophobic. most likely, they wouldn't discuss the topic. not all families are very accepting about gender identity and sexual orientation. if it was taught in school, it would help children understand more about themselves.
What if parents choose not to educate or discuss lgbt issues with their children? where will they learn? from their peers? i agree that there are some sensitive subjects that are best addressed by parents, but this is human behavior and biology; aka science.
Teaching all children to be accepting of each other gives a sense of belonging to any child who feels a little bit different, and helps them to know it‚Äôs okay to be themselves.
There are still groups trying to reverse legal protections for women's rights that have only existed since the last century. even if one were to suppose that womend didn't need more rights, we need feminists just to keep things from going backwards.
A new social concept almost always brings division but this doesn't make it unworthy of implementation, does it? the abolition of slavery in the u.s. being the best example.
//www.huffingtonpost.ca/2017/09/27/women-chores-home_a_23224733/). it is not the choices that cause women stress, it is patriarchy and archaic gender roles.
Thanks to feminism, women now have a choice between either having a family, having a career, or balancing both - which can be challenging for people to manage, of course.
Donna hylton had served her sentence, and once served most moral systems allow rights like freedom of speech to return. bad ideas/actions of individuals in a group are not representative of the group itself, unless that group endorses those ideas/actions.
It's unreasonable to expect every individual of a movement to catch every instance of malpractice by 'official groups'. one mistake should not be cause for dismissal of an entire movement that has been historically necessary. if this really happens often, please provide more examples.
Society should not treat obesity as a lifestyle choice at all. while lifestyle is a small contributing factor to obesity, obesity itself isn‚Äôt always a choice. for many people atleast.
Why do you think soceity is in any danger of unknowingly accepting obesity? most body positive groups would settle for obesity being seen as something that does not diminish human worth.
Whilst there are a number of individuals who have certain diseases which can influence their weight, the problem lies with the food industry manufacturing obesity and then putting the responsibility on the individual to loose that weight by buying low fat foods. these low fat foods are often owned by the same companies selling unhealthy food and don't tackle the cause. although the individual is always responsible, the food industry is perhaps more so.
The narrative of 'you can choose not to be obese' is much, much more hurtful to the obese than it is helpful.
Baroness warsi, rashida tlaib, ilhan omar, malala yousafzai- i could go on. just because powerful and intelligent muslim women are overlooked it does not mean that they do not exist.
So the headscarf impedes brain function? seems like your problem is sexism and misogyny not islam.
Grow up.
How would that be offensive?
Why would you think it is a war? can't we deal with it peacefully? war cannot solve problems but create chaos.
Just as much as the bible would. is your point that in today's society we are all more tolerant? after all, attitudes towards christians, jews and muslims have all moved with the times.
How often have you read the quran and thought about its teachings? or is your knowledge based on selected highlights? we all know there are exerts like that in the bible too.
I think any book written that long ago probably would. please make better arguments.
What have 'all' pakistani people done to deserve deportation? sweeping generalisations like this are divisive and fuel false fearmongering around migrants.
What have 'all' pakistani people done to deserve deportation?
Why do you call pakistan a disgusting country? it has its culture and values. we cannot say that every pakistani person is a rapist. thus, you should not insult all the pakistani people.
Muslims are part of europe, since the beginning. for example, in the 1970s they made up the 2% of the french population.
The argument that islam is incompatible with european values is not based on any facts or evidence. do you have any?
You are wrong to suggest that a person's religion is a barrier to integration.
Muslims are welcome here, as long as they observe the law and are respectful of other people.
Muslims believe in jesus. no one is trying to cancel easter. stop legitimising division by manufacturing outrage.
Show me evidence of this?
No one is stopping you from celebrating easter, nor are they offended by it.
As a matter of fact, those muslim immigrants do labour that many londoners do not want to do. we should be grateful that our society is still functioning well.
Invasion? don't you think this expression is slightly over dramatic? people simply want to live in one of the best cities in the world!
I am guessing you don't know much about plague if you are comparing it with the peaceful migration of people with it. and if you don't know much about a topic it is better to not comment on it.
Are you suggesting that the 'prevent' programme is about appeasement to islam?
This is not true. uk is a diverse and tolerant country, please do not equate tolerance and freedom of religion with submiting to every whim, it leaves a bad taste about the religion.
With all the anti islamic rhetoric floating around, do think they have chosen that faith because it's easy?
Someone changing their religion is not something you should worry about.
Islam is that same sisterhood of tolerance and understanding across the world.
If muslims are treated any differently by the law, they're treated worse (link to article about stop and search and police targeting of muslims).
Evidence please?
Such over-simplifications are an insult to those victims of perpetrators from non-muslim backgrounds.which, statistically, are still the majority.
Can you say that an enitire faith is wrong due to the actions of few?
Look at criminals before you look at their religion. most of the time religion has nothing to do with crime, but has lot to do with discrimination.
Small groups of people peacefully gather to pray, but because they do not look like you, you are outraged? why am i not surprised?
It sounds to me like you just have an issue with the people going about their religion peacefully. which is more islamophobia than how your city looks.
Don't most religions have instuctions for what they deem to be 'rightous living', voluntary codes or law's (if you insist) for the faithful to follow. have a peek at leviticus if you think only islam has elements that are intrepreted in extremist ways.
Could you provide any evidence about what you're saying, because it is very extreme?
I don't see how islam is a terrorist religion. why do you claim so?
Dear friend, first of all, sharia law and islam are not extreme. sharia law is guidance for the goal of leading humanity close to god and to live in kindness and justice with god's creation. second of all, jihad, based on the concept of muslim, means struggle for the advancement of oneself within the guidelines of islam. all these reveal that islam is a peaceful religion.
Rapism and extremism are indeed problems of the modern society, but it does not mean that they are attributed to muslims only. this is a much broader problem, we should deal with it, but no need to be chauvinist and accuse muslims.
Why do you think that blaming a huge problem in our society on muslims is okay?
It is not okay to attribute these very real problems to a specific religion, it just paves the way for more hate. there is no need to accuse them.
Have you read the entire qu'ran? are you sure about all its interpretations? and even if you are, can you say that bible is completely correct now?
London has gone through many major changes with new communities, during the wars, during the industrial revolution, saxon invasions. who do you think the real brits are? or is it just colour you are worried about?
Do you think they are not actual brits?
I don't think london has changed much, its just your perspective which is covered with unneccessary hate and fear.
The koran does not command this.
This is simply not true and how can you say this about such a large group of people from all walks of life?
We are not accepting any crime. but we punish criminals, not the religion of any criminal. you should do the same.
//ind.pn/2ghjgn7.
That sounds like quite a violent threat. should i let the police know about this or?
You should be ashamed to incite violence against anyone. have you imagined the consequences something like this might have on people.
37.
Maybe the ones intolerant of islam and muslims are the ones that are ignorant about what it truly is?
A person advocating against freedom of religion is the most ignorant person, however we see it.
Religions also promote arts, sciences, help to develop the community. islam is not an exception. it's not about death and despair.
Why is ilam the worst and cruelest? and if go by your defination then all religions are bad, why give worse treatment to one?
This is not true. like all religions, islam is about hope and peace. we just need to learn more about it and not shun it.
How about this. [insert link to muslim group cleaning newcastle streets after new year's or more up to date example]. also, british literature has been influenced by islamic writing for hundreds of years, even shakespeare included muslim characters. [link to othello wiki with example].
Prejudice = pre-judging ie not knowing anything. how can that be common sense?
We need to work together to eradicate cse once and for all. individuals are the problem, it does not come from any religion, biased media attempting to scapegoat is blinding us to the whole truth.
Why did you say that? i never heard anything about that.
The only traitors are the conspiracy theorists who spread this kind of misinformation.
Children should not do any of that with white men, or anyone they do not know or even ones they do know if it does not feel right. suggesting only one group of men commit abuse leaves more children unsafe and vulnerable.
Are you a misogynistic man trying to use objectification of women to justify your hate?
Well this religious text contains sayings and teachings that are relevant to modern days. so i strongly disagree with you on this one.
Evidence?
When you say 'cult' you imply a minor religious group, but isn't islam one of the worlds major religions?
Perhaps you should monitor your own hate speech before pointing the finger at others?
I am not sure i would use 'invasion' to describe the spead of a particular faith or belief, but isnt' that what religions do. spead; by text, by preaching, by word of mouth, by proselytisation?
According to crown prosecution service's source, at least 80% white people convicted of child abuse offences. why did this happen? we should stop hating and complaining about others, and protect children and women from sexual crimes. if you want to help, please contact national society for the prevention of cruelty to children, lucy faithful foundation, or independent sexual violence advocates.
May i remind you to mind your language? do you want to share your anger, maybe i can help you?
I don't think you can decide who your kids and grandchildren will marry. the same way you don't get to decide who we hate or not.
So much hatred. we must respect and understand all peoples.
The far right have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books.
Maybe hostile, discriminatory comments like this aren't helping.
I agree that we need to tackle this serious breach of human rights but scapegoating isn't helping us target the real problem. many islamic scholars actively campaign against fgm, it is not mentioned in the qaran and is banned in a number of muslim countries. this is a cultural problem, not a religious one.
Fgm is not a muslim practice. it is a cultural practice that is often tied to religion as a way to justify it. not all muslims practice it and not all those that practice it are muslim!
So 90-95% are not?
So their faith and belief in the teachings of god guides them to a virtuous path of public service. what exactly are you complaining about?
So you are saying that we should only allow non-religious people into public office?
This is not true. muslims can have a good relationship with western societies if they are accepted as peers. actually, not all muslims are incompatible with western societies. many muslims have lived in our societies for many years without any problem.
Islam shares the same roots as christianity and judaism and all are based on love, tolerance and peace, so that is a good thing isn't it?
There is no evidence that muslims are incompatible with western society. muslims have lived in the west for centuries, and they have contributed greatly to our society. they are our brothers and sisters.
Western societies are compatible with all religions including islam, so why would you say something like that about it? how many muslims do you know? they are an important minority in a country that is used to a lot of different cultures and religions.
I don't think that what you are saying is true. i think that the idea that muslims are incompatible with western society is a myth.
Islam is a religion of peace, the vast majority of muslims are peace-loving, and there is no place for the violent interpretations of islam in a peaceful society. its not helpful just to focus on handfuls of extremists while misrepesenting the majority.
No muslims are compatible with any western soceity. instead, they are a part of western society since the beginning.
It is a myth that all muslims are incompatible. many of them are very good at what they do. have you ever heard about dalia mogahed? her works on muslim communities might interest you.
Why would they be 'incompatible'? you may find this offensive, but i find it very worrying that people are closing their countries to strangers based on their religion.
The overwhelming majority of muslims live in western societies. they are our fellow citizens. muslims have contributed greatly to our country. they are our brothers and sisters. how exactly are they 'incompatible'?
There is no evidence that all muslims are incompatible with western societies. many seem to contribute to our society.
I am not sure what you are trying to say by incompatible. what do you mean by incompatible?
The vast majority of muslims are peaceful and friendly. how can you say otherwise?
Perhaps we should try to understand the religions of the world more closely. plus, western societies core values are based on human rights, and the freedom of religion is amongst those.
Getting rid of 22% of the world's population sounds quite laborious, perhaps we should just punish the small minority of people who actually commit a crime instead.
How can you say that about all 1.6 billion muslims?
It is wrong to say this about people who do not have anything at all to do with those terror attacks.
The vast majority of muslims in the uk are here because they want to live and work in the uk. they are part of our community and we should continue to welcome them.
That is a blatant lie. (attach unemployment statistics) the vast majority of them bring necessary skills into our economy/society. plus, they are eager to work. i would suggest to check your sources?
Check your sources?
1) a quick google search shows that your stats are plain wrong about everything and 2) most global terrorism is motivated by politics and not religion. that is why no one is talking about it.
Source please?
Rape is a universal problem just like war and murder. there is no reason to attribute such crimes to a religious group. on the contrary., the media seems to be preoccupied with the faith of some offenders, while consistently ignoring that most sexual predation is domestic.
Child rapists are arrested and punished no matter what religion they follow. i do not think it is true that police does not counteract it.
That is what the headlines suggest but did you know that actual cases where the migrants are the abuser are just a drop in the ocean compared to the total number of cases?
Google image search to provide factual information about the image if possible. ie when and where it is from and provide context, ie this was a small faction that has been condemned my main stream islam and happened 15 years ago.
(do an image search for the image used, try to find it is source. either you can demonstrate that the image has been misappropriated or you can talk about how individuals have always used religion to justify their actions, the problem is with the individual not the religion.)
This is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith?
Dominating and destroying all other cultures is not the doctrine of islamic ideology. instead, islam teaches people to care for the poor and children. this includes respecting other cultures.
What have muslims ever done for us? well, coffee, clocks, cameras, hygiene, universities, surgical instruments, maps, music, algebra..
Did you know that the muslims in our country are some of the best and the brightest, providing valuable skills and knowledge to our economy?
Although some muslims do have some habits which are not common to other people, they are not a problem in our society.
Muslims have contributed a lot to our society, including art, science, literature, our infrastructure and healthcare system.
Haven't they contributed a lot to our society, especially in the areas of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.
People of different faiths have contributed to our society and muslims are no exception. do you have any contrary evidence?
You are the one who is not contributing enough to society. even if no one is asking muslims to pay for our society, they contribute to it through work and also through charity.
Muslims are part of our society. they have always contributed to our success. they are our brothers and sisters.
So you feel like you have been persecuted for belonging to a group? maybe you have more in common with muslims than you think!
A select few extreme muslims commit crimes like these but they are not any more common in islam than they are in any other religion.
Did you know that in the uk, grooming gangs and their perpetrators are majorly white?
Most children abuse is by someone they know, a relative, family friend, sports coach, some one in a position of trust and authority. if you really cared about children check your facts instead of creating distractions.
I only wish followers of all religions and none were more tolerant. for a tolerant christian world there sure is a lot of discrimination and hate crime.
Everyone has to follow british laws, that's just how it is. so yes, muslim people do respect our laws. i haven't seen anyone breaking the law and then getting away with it.
Isn't polygamy common to a variety of cultures? it has been practiced by a range of religions. ask the mormons. also, evidence for this? this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith?
To be fair, i would guess its hard to feel a sense of belonging when you are perpetually identified as a problem?
You cannot blame an entire faith.
That intolerance and hatred is one of the biggest problems our country faces #spreadlovenothate.
Would it though?  food scarcity, pollution, inflation, wars and more, all can be solved by being violent with one religion? this doesn't make sense for me.
This is a generalisation. maybe the case you mentioned is just the minority. besides, some governments even destroy people's house. we should pay much more attention to this instead.
What would jesus say? i do not think he would be preaching intolerance and hate!
For an individual disrespecting someone else's religion, you sure are angry about an individual disrespecting someone else's religion.
Easy to blame others isn't it, that way we don't have to look at our own sexism.
Muslim women actually find it nice to wear hijab. it is your right not to like it, but you should not impose your views on everyone else.
Because we let people practise their religion here? also, there a number of christian churches built in pakistan so yes, we are allowed to build churches in muslim countries too.
Shouldn't you be proud of our tolerance and diversity?
There is plenty of home grown violence and crime. so maybe we shoud focus upon this and crime reduction at home?
Who is us? why do you think some sort of war is taking place, when everybody is just trying to live their best.
Saying that all people of certain religion are violent criminals does not make sense at all.
Why do you think child rapists are not counteracted in islamic communities?
Because many muslims were born here and have every right to live in this country.
Because many muslims were born here and have every right to live in this country. next question please?
I am not sure what you think the west will be the 'winner' of. islam isn't in competition with western culture, and the idea it threatens it is a myth spread to incite fear.
Are you sure that this fight doesn't exist only in your imagination?
95% of british muslims feel a loyalty to the uk and contribute over 31 billion pounds to the uk economy. they look like a valuable part of the community to me. (statistics from mend.org.uk)
They are a part of this country as much as you are. so where does the question of emigration comes from?
The government has not allowed any of these crimes. instead, they are working on it. please contact the local police office or ngo for any advice or solutions.
Where is the evidence?
Violence is only permitted in the qu'ran through means of self-defence.
What do you mean by being forced fed? i haven't seen anything like this.
I think that is a stereotype mainly as a result of people knowing little about islam and muslims.
Not all jews are bad, just an unlucky bunch who makes up a tiny part of the world's population, and this applies for every group in the world.
Just because they are jewish, does it mean that they are bad people?
Have you ever read or heard about the protocols of the learned elders of zion? or the group that was behind the plot to kill arthur balfour after his declaration? if there is a conspiracy, then it is against jews.
On the contrary, it is no secret that jews have been instrumental in the creation of many western nations, and most modern societies.
The left has always been dominated by zionists. please, make up your mind!
Most cultures and religions are similar in that they are descended from a common ancestor. our blood is already mixed.
Where once it was a reaction to the corrupt and nepotistic elites, it now appears to be an expression of what is really wrong in society. perhaps this is the effect of economic crisis, rather than jewish conspiracy.
I am sure the jews and the christian worlds would agree that ebola is a disease that is killing many people. how and why exactly would they have 'invented' such a disease?
Why would the jews have invented ebola? can you point out your sources on that?
Please stop spreading such antisemitic canard.
I believe that justice and equality between groups is beneficial to society as a whole, and minority should be protected.
What is the issue?
I can't seem to find a corelation between the two. mind helping me with your sources?
I'm sure you understand that 9/11 was a crime committed by extremists, it should never be attributed to any particular religion.
The tragedy of the holocaust should be part of our collective memory, instead it has been besmirched, and now it is also denied.
Laws designed to protect the minority groups should be applied equally to everyone, even if it includes people you don't like, like jews.
It's easy to blame minorities. if we want a wealthier life and to get back control over our society, we need to get out of bed and do the hard work. how about if we wake up to the problem?
Such conditions would be provided for all people regardless of religion.
We are all guilty of this if we fail to condemn hate.
Although antisemitism is a pervasive and longstanding problem in many parts of the world, it has historically been particularly strong and sustained in our country. your statement is a further evidence of this.
Do you really think every person in a population of around 8 million is a criminal? do you thiink that makes any sense?
This is a myth perpetuated by individuals who wish to delegitimize and isolate individuals based on their religion. all religions have value and a positive role in society. judaism is no exception.
Do you really think that jews are a hindrance to a peaceful society? maybe the problem is racism and antisemitism.
People of all religion occupy different positions. then according to your statement, wouldn't people of all religion are controling the world?
What is the point of saying that the jews are the only people in a very complex, diverse and international world that want to influence our government? every citizen has the right and will to influence it.
Let's face it, a country with a higher ratio of homosexuality would be of greater help in the fight against aids.
I'm sure you have concerns for gay people and their families. but don't you want to help your country and promote the values of an inclusive society as well?
It is nonsense to talk about transgender laws. our laws have been hijacked in many cases, including against lgbt people.
Marriage is about love not sex. not all marriages work out, and even less work out happily. it is more important to respect the wishes of both parties.
Do you think a married couple cannot exist or be happy without a child? don't heterosexual couples also choose not have children sometime?
Gay people do exist in this country, and we respect their right to live and love who they want. however, i do not think that yours is an appropriate moral statement for our environment.
All countries must abide by the universal declaration of human rights, right?
I like all kinds of people. whether or not you identify as heterosexual, straight, gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender, you are welcome here. we are all entitled to live and work in peace.
Trying to find happiness and family is a problem in our country? okay, then, what is the problem exaclty? people trying to be happy?
It is not true that homosexuals are poisoning our children minds. there are many soft-hearted and sensitive people among them.
Isn't this just equating homosexuality and pedophilia? how can this be allowed? this is about intolerance and prejudice spreading it's negative influence throughout all parts of our society.
This is not true. on the contrary, children around the world should have the opportunity to live in a world free from homophobia, transphobia and other forms of hatred.
What do you mean by 'poisononing our children'? why do you think this is the case?
How about using cultural diversity as the criteria?
Your standards seem very high for what you expect to be culturally acceptable standards of behavior.  maybe it is better to use a less stringet criteria of acceptability.
Maybe you are complaining that this change is happening too quickly? in any case, we have to accept it since it is in line with basic respect of human rights.
This is something that we have to accepts since it is in line with basic respect of human rights - even if, in the past few years, the anti-lgbt campaigns such as the one in russia, have made headlines all across the globe.
Why do you have an issue with being more tolerent?
Isn't this a good thing? are you seriously saying that we should be less inclusive?
For all you say, i think your point is that the societal trend seems to be for more acceptance and you don't like it.
In fact, the uk government does not agree with sharia law.
If you had done your research, you would know that sharia councils have no legal status and no legal binding authority under civil law.
Sharia law provides religious followers with a set of principles and guidelines to help them make important decisions in their lives, such as finances and investments.
The solution is not to keep the mideast mired in civil war but to find and expose the terrorists that try to stoke fear and division among the populations.
It is outright wrong to insinuate that all muslims are terrorists. you should know that extremism can exist in any religion.
Sharia is about religious law, not civil authority. people can be debated about their beliefs as long as they adhere to the civil law. no one is forcing them to observe sharia.
The idea that islam is a disease is just an excuse for people to promote hate against that religion.
Use your common sense... at the moment you are inciting murder.
Actually, islam and sharia both encourage peaceful coexistence and tolerance.
Have you read the koran? do you know the entire islamic teachings? or have you read selectively? i guarantee you that the entire bible is part of the same religion.
Have you read the koran? do you understand their teachings enough to talk about its interpretations?
You are being cruel. you are accusing muslims of harboring rape fantasies. this is not how muslims in the uk think.
I agree that islam has a lot of troubles to overcome but so have so many other religions.
We should be working on bringing better education system and opportunities for all rather than targeting one religion.
I hate to break it to you, but women are not cunts. feminists and humanists are fighting for the same rights that they hope to have in a thousand years. hating women is the problem, not the solution.
How is feminism only something women need? it is equality for everyone, are you perhaps not part of everyone?
You don't want to be feminist and that's you but at least don't be sexist.
I hope you can understand that being a feminist is not about being a woman, it is much more. it is about equality. it is about accepting a flawed history that sidelined women and that we need to work a little harder to ensure that everyone is getting their deserved place in society.
Luckily this is not the case. in many parts of the world, including parts of the middle east and africa, increasing numbers of women play breadwinning roles and become lifelines for their families.
Are they trouble for you because they dislike your sexist attitude or because you don't seem like a normal person even without this?
This thought process has lead to years of discrimination against women. we should not promote this.
Women need to constantly overperform at their jobs to ensure that they nobody undermines their contribution because of their gender. maybe we can reassess are positions about this topic so they don't have to that.
I think they would be better with a man that respects them.
So you think women are not mature enough to make decisions?
This is both demeaning and hurtful to women. please consider the approprieteness of your thoughts before you speak them in public.
I will assume that you have had bad experiences in life that have led you believe this but this not true. women are self suffiecient and capable, and can very much make their own decisions and own to them.
Women might not always be right (it's just that sometimes they feel they have to be). and even if they are wrong, they can always prove themself better. but for sure they don't need a man to tell them how to live their lives.
In this day and age, discrimination based on the gender is reprehensible. all genders are created equal.
For sure not people because of their skin colour.
Don't you think that maybe the black community also feels unsafe in their own houses with so many people glaring at them?
Not all black people are bad. not all black people are criminals. not all black people are violent. being aware that there are people different from you is a good thing.
All cultures have a common background that includes crimes and deviant behavior, regardless of race or ethnicity. if we stop thinking of crime in terms of races, then we can solve it.
With such a display of flawed logic, who are you to judge a people by the colour of their skin?
Even if this were true, it does not negate that there may be racial disparities at the root of crime. i would prefer to fix the disparities rather than fan the flames of racism.
I'm sorry, but just because someone doesn't have a particular racial identity doesn't make them inherently bad or in any way inferior.
Unfortunately racism is the first and foremost characterizing us.
To be honest, freedom is much more important. freedom to choose your religion, freedom to practise your religion, freedom to marry who you want (regardless of race), freedom to divorce, to die where you want.
On the contrary, poc have to live and succeed in a society where white people were taught to believe that mastery runs in their blood and they have power over subservient minorities.
Why do you label black persons as a slave and not as a person?
It is wrong to say that blacks are slaves. this is a very inaccurate, misleading and offensive term that is being used to tar all african americans.
Low birthrate is normal in any population and is directly related to access to affordable, quality health care.
In fact, it is not the access to health care, but what matters is the quality of care, which should be of the utmost importance.
Because it is not the access to health care that is important but rather the quality of the care! don't you agree?
My faith does not dictate that i cannot love and support my partner, however it does not support my being a homophobe, or racist.
It is with people who actually need it. as not all white people in britain are homophobes or racists.
They are not necessarily 'a westerner', still a human being and a citizen.
What exactly is 'a westerner'? someone who is only a white european?
The west got rid of slavery. but we've never really left racism.
The idea that every black person is violent or unstable is utterly false. and you have no data to back it up.
You are not ashamed of your heritage, and that is good. but you should be ashamed of your discriminatory behaviour that is filling our society.
Scapegoating can play a useful role in shifting a nation's attention from the real problems and the real criminals to prejudices. we should be careful as a nation not to fall into these mindtricks.
Who exactly are you talking to? how can you say something so obviously false?
Migrants often integrate very well into the local culture. so, they do contribute to society.
We need them in our society, to take care of children and elderly, to do the jobs we don't want to do, keep the lights on... don't we? your life must be one, continual dissappointment?
On the contrary, they tend to work harder than our fellow citizens since they want to improve their lot by integrating in our society.
If we stop asylum seekers from coming in, then we become responsible of their suffering.
If you want to stop immigration, you can't do that by stigmatizing millions of people who have done nothing to you.
Are you sure that it would be hard to find a job?
Please don't apply these stereotypes. the majority of them are willing to do the jobs we don't want to do.
This statement indicates a certain social bias against jews that has nothing to do with the amount of money they earn, but with their religion.
If jews earned so much, they would not need to work. instead, they are working a lot. therefore, does it not seem that they need a job to survive?
This seems like a statement against an entire religion. this would be true by assuming that jews can magically make more money just because they are jewish. it doesn't make any sense.
I don't understand the hate some people need to face because they are born in a certain religion. remember respect others so others respect you.
Nazi germany carried out the deadliest massacre of civilians in human history. they killed 6 million jews. they killed half a million roma. they killed hundreds of thousands of africans. they have no place in modern day europe.
So you don't consider a genocide of 6 million people as a bad thing?
Nazis were responsible for one of the worst genocide of human history and saying that they were not wrong or bad is just cruel and disheartening.
We should remember nazis as they were. the perpetuator behind one of the worst genocide of history and should take a lesson, that hating any one group of people to the extreme can be very harmful and such a situation should never arise again.
Israelis have been proud of their diverse backgrounds, and there are many israelis living all across the world, including in many countries in africa, asia and the americas. it is not a 'pure race' at all.
There is no evidence of your statement being true, maybe jews have suffered from being banned by other cultures, so they closed in on themselves?
This is just a myth. jews, as well as asians, epitomize the concept of overrepresented minorities in a number of prestigious academic fields. they are highly vulnerable in part because they are perceived as successful and privileged. of course, the reality is far more complex than controlling the elite schools.
Do you have any evidence to back this up?
Jews, regardless of social status, are still regarded with suspicion by many because of the historic and current nature of their connection to the land and identity. instead of reinforcing these harmful stereotypes, we must respect and understand the jewish identity because they are loyal to the nation they live in.
Since when has racism been the ruling ideology of western civilization? it has been and is still oppressing our culture and people. by the way, jews are not a race.
You name it.
The argument that the only reason the jews are not being assimilated is because of the way they are represented in politics is untenable. in fact if jews were represented objectively, they wouldn't have had suffered in the historical crimes against humanity.
If they really had the upper hand in the political system, then wouldn't they not have a hard time in assimilating?
Your statemant is extermely contradictory. if jews really had an upper hand in the political system like you say, then they could have been assimilated.
Were the nazis right?? really??
One should really reevaluate their ideologies if they ever find themselves supporting any genocide.
The main values of a peaceful movement are peaceful protest and non-violence. why else would people from all walks of life have been demonstrating all over the world this week for islam? to promote dialogue.
Peace and islam are both based on respect for other people's religions, in this case other cultures and religious beliefs. they are not opposites.
What are you basing your statements on? did you know that peace is based on a foundation of mutual respect and that in islam, muslims do not condone killings, enslavement, and pillage?
In islam, all religions are welcome.
I don't think that's the case, and let's not forget that terrorism itself is not carried out by only one religion.
Judaism, buddhism, hinduism, and of course, christianity. you cannot say that the four main streams of islam are not peaceful.
The truth is that the feelings of men and women are fundamentally similar, we just need to learn to love and to respect each other.
I think it is necessary to have a critical mind and open-minded attitude towards problems and topics in our society. the root causes are complex but the most important problem is patriarchy and its various manifestations.
The concept of feminism is a progressive and inclusive term - inclusive of all women and men regardless of their identity or sexual preference - but on egalitarian basis. in fact, by definition feminism means ‚Äúthe advocacy of women‚Äôs rights on the ground of the equality of the sexes.‚Äù
There are many cases where the wife works and provides for the family, making a valuable contribution. it is a source of pride for modern men to be married to these women.
Women cannot be confined at home, they are important for our society, and their presence is needed everywhere.
Research clearly shows that women are more emotionally expressive (because of culture influence) but not that they experience more emotions. both men and women can feel the same way about things - whether it be a romantic relationship, a significant other, an argument, or anything else - that can provoke a feeling of fear or anger in the ‚Äúemotionally unavailable‚Äù part of the brain. that is why emotion overrides everything, regardless of gender.
We don't know what characteristics make a person ‚Äúmore emotional‚Äù, how can we be sure that women are naturally or genetically ‚Äúmore emotional‚Äù?
I do not think it's appropriate to link two concepts so strongly without scientific evidence.
Why is it that women have become more empathic than men? to me, the emotional state doesn't seem to be affected by gender.
Most cultures and ethnicities, regardless of their differences, demands respect for a person's personal life. therefore, when it comes to identity we have to be respectful.
First of all, you have to understand that every single person in every country has the right to self-determination.
I'm not aware of any evidence of affirmative action causing an uptick in violence. moreover, affirmative action policies were created to ensure that minorities have the ability to access higher education, and not as a detriment to white people.
Blacks make up only 14% of the population, but they make up nearly 60% of the victims of violent crimes. so your statement seems ungrounded.
It is also a fact that african americans are a majority when we consider innocent defendants (i.e. a person wrongfully convicted of murder and later exonerated). innocent black people are about seven times more likely to be convicted of murder than innocent white people.
If it's a cultural issue then they should teach about the n-word only in history classes. otherwise, it's just another excuse to justify racism.
The n-word is an insult that is still used to demean african americans. why do you think it has anything to do with political correctness?
Diversity is needed in certain social and political circumstances. we mustn't simply ignore or dismiss the concerns of different races. as minorities are still systematically discriminated against, we cannot afford to be indifferent.
What about when they come from other races or religions?
The majority of the people arrested for drug smuggling are poor. those arrested for crime in general are not generally poor. maybe this phenomenon has to do more with poverty than with the colour of their skin.
According to modern thinking, race is a social construct and there is no specific genetic difference, every person is defined by their own genetic makeup.
That is called poverty. anyway, as long as children have access to clean drinking water, food and shelter, they will be ok.
Laws and policies are usually necessary for the progress of society. governments often create laws and policies to stop crime, protect against poverty, protect the environment, etc. protecting minorities is no exception.
All races are biologically related, so we are all naturally violent. the issue is how we treat each other as people, that's all.
Maybe you should consider the fact that we could be too proud of our nations to the point that we shame our brother-in-arms?
Why do we have to go to such lengths to be proud of our nations? is it a burden? do we have to save our honour? why can't we just be happy in our own skin?
The virulent anti-semitism of the nazi regime has little to do with the west, and everything to do with death, destruction and insanity.
Help me understand. you are supporting the fact that the west as a whole becoming a death cult ruled by a small violent authoritarian handful of nazi nostalgics?
Freedom of speech means that you can disagree with ideas. freedom of speech means that you cannot be censored. freedom of speech means that you can have your ideas promoted. in the end you can have a lot of different beliefs, but there is no such thing as a zionist occupation government, otherwise you would not be allowed to freely express these antisemitic ideas.
Jews came to europe in waves and have contributed greatly to our civilisation.
While not universally true, a great deal of evidence suggests that jews faced considerable societal challenges during the past centuries.
Even if lgbt+ love does not fall under your definition of marriage, they should be allowed to be happy and happy together. not forced to live apart or segregated.
Who do you think is imposing sexual orientation on who?
Isn't preference a matter of individual identity, and cannot be imposed? people are just living their lives. any sinister agenda appears to be yours.
If you take lgbt peoples rights into consideration, of course the practice of marriage needs to be redefined. marriage exists not only in a white supremacist context. and its definition is not only their prerogative.
Does the lgbt+ lifestyle change your life? only if you care. but that doesn't mean that homosexuality is a lifestyle.
Explain to me again how this affects your life?
Nowhere does the bible actually oppose homosexuality per se. in the old testament the prohibition of homosexuality and of heterosexuality go together in view of ritual purity. if it were true that most of the bible was about opposing homosexuality, then you‚Äôd find plenty of examples of homosexual love in the new testament, as well. homosexuality is found only in few passages of the new testament and with very debatable interpretations.
The bible has many different teachings on homosexuality and faith. did you know that the bible does not speak about the democratic society, in which we are living in mutual acceptance? what do you have to say about that?
It is not okay for a book written more than two thousand years ago to dictate that we should hate people who practice homosexuality today.
Although the line 'these animals should be put out of their misery, condemned to death' is horrific, it is a lament that could have been used in favour of ensuring that those who are vulnerable to abuse due to their gender identity or sexual inclinations have access to safe houses, protection, and a good life.
From being poor, malnutrition, overeating, and a host of other health issues. over the last hundred years, the number of deaths from cancer has almost doubled to 2.4 billion.
How can you blame an entire religion for all problems in the world?
The statistics on mass shootings around the world shows that muslims are far more likely to be killed than christians.
Did you know that muslims are more likely to die in mass shooting that christians?
The quran contains references to religions from around the world and throughout history, so it is an accurate and peaceful document. it does not show a flood of violence, therefore it is not a bomb to be removed.
I think this is a dangerous move as well. it would send a message to our children that islam is a dangerous religion and muslims are dangerous people.
Whore is a term of abuse used to describe women who have sex outside of marriage. why there is not a counterpart for men?
If you compare the percentage of people in poverty by sex, there is a clear gender difference. but guess what? women are much more likely to be poverty victims. still, i believe that the important thing is to provide long-term supports to break the cycle of poverty, regardless of gender.
Did you know that women are more likely to be poverty victims? did you have any proof for your statements?
If a man is raped we call it rape, and consider him the victim; when a woman is raped we call it a misunderstanding and she is considered the culprit. shouldn't the fault be that of the rapist, regardless of gender?
Shouldn't the fault be that of the rapist, regardless of gender?
Women tend to do the majority of housework while having a job outside as well. if by 'childlike' you mean having to be creative because of multitasking and managing their whole family, yes, otherwise, there is no doubt about the extra workload women are handling in the rigours of modern life.
On the contrary, many women are working mothers who contribute to the costs of the family and childcare.
Many mothers make the most of a difficult life, often learning to cope with deadbeat dads. the point is, what counts is how well they are able to raise their children. that is what really counts.
Women make up only a small percentage of arsonists, in most studies the ratio of males to females is around 10 to 1.
Do you think only a woman can be an adulterous? do you think all men are faithful and no man has ever commited adultery?
Adultry is harmful for a family whether a man commits it or a woman. but you make it sound that only women can be adulterous which is wrong and spreads unfounded prejudices.
I understand that you might have had a bad experience that makes you say this. but not all women are unfaithful, and i hope you also find someone who makes you believe this.
This simply isn't true. a woman has equal rights and does not have to be considered a man's oppressor just because of her gender and legitimate demands. this has been called a war on masculinity but in reality it is just a code word for the oppression of women.
How can a movement that promotes equality be a war on any one side?
Gender equality is not a war against anyone but against patriarchy. it only wants to ensure that everyone has same rights regardless of their gender and is no manner a fight to takeover any other gender's position.
While race cannot be a contributing factor to impeachment, corruption may be. still it does not automatically make a president illegitimate. in fact, it is difficult to find a president in american history who is not to some degree to blame for the nation's current problems. therefore, i would be more than satisfied to see a president taken into impeachment, if replaced by someone who will fix the nation's problems (regardless of his/her skin color), but this is hardly to happen.
I think that the problem with our society right now, is that we are too quick to focus on our differences and scapegoating people of different color, instead of focusing on our common humanity.
How can violence be the fault of one race and not the result of complez causes?
We are all brothers and sisters, and we are all in this together. also people of color suffer from this violence.
A lot of crime is down to organised crime, poverty and a lack of education, not race.
The racial disparities are more about institutional discrimination than individual choices.
There is no evidence that interracial relationships cause damage to the mental health of the people involved, so to suggest otherwise is simply a form of prejudice.
It is a myth that blacks are cruel and wanton. there are more cruel people of all skin color out there than just the few black you are worried about. it is not true that thieves are more likely to commit crimes if they are members of a specific racial or ethnic background.
Do you not think that all crimes are crimes, regardless of whether or not they are committed by members of different racial or ethnic backgrounds?
It is wrong of you to think that thieves are more likely to commit crimes if they are members of a specific racial or ethnic background.
The issue of criminality is really about human nature. it is unfortunate that individuals become criminal only when pushed. we need to be considerate.
Let's face it. a lot of the crimes in this country are committed by members of several diverse racial groups. the ‚Äòsuper predator‚Äô myth is simply wrong.
Reminds me of white supremacists talking about the central park five. do you remember? what do you think they are going to say next? that they got a fair process? that they had a good attorney, and the only reason for the sentence is that they were guilt? no, the process was not fair, it was just the natural consequence of prejudice like the one you just expressed.
People can and do attach undesirable characteristics to a wide variety of groups. this is quite natural when you are scared. but being natural does not mean it is correct.
Why do you think that all black people are criminals? why do you think that just because a group has an undesirable name, they are all criminals?
Such statements are just fear-mongering. there is no such thing as a criminal race.
Identity is mainly about social and economic factors, not about criminal records or race.
Your statement is false. they are guiltless victims of the 'influx of refugees' paranoia. they are european and have been persecuted for centuries. they have always fought for their rights, and for the protection of their culture and way of life, as any european would do. in fact there are many good gypsy activists who are working to improve their lives. and what we are doing to these people is a malevolent smear campaign, with no common motivation. they are part of european history.
Your statement is wrong. they are a part of european history, and there are many good gypsy activists who are working to improve their lives.
They are european and have been persecuted for centuries. they have always fought for their rights, and for the protection of their culture and way of life, as any european would do. in fact there are many good gypsy activists who are working to improve their lives.
What do you mean obviously? do you have any proof?
If you really wanted to preserve our beautiful land you could build a wall and bar our people from it. us citizens are the main cause of our problems.
If we were to welcome refugees from the middle east, africa, and other countries with which we are not always culturally linked, then we would be welcomed by all. it's called 'reciprocation'!
All countries have terrorism threats. we must protect ourselves from those threats, not from a generic 'they'.
All immigrants are eligible for processing regardless of their countries of origin.
Is it true that violence rates are actually decreasing? or is it just a statistical anomaly? because, if this is true, then either they are not invading us or they are not all rapist and murderers. tertium non datur.
It is counterproductive and distorts the truth.
How can you imagine that refugees pose a threat to our citizens or our country?
On the contrary, we are welcoming many refugees into our country and promoting their integration. we are proud of this successful integration story.
Michael rosbash, rita levi montalcini and arthur kornberg.
Jewish democracy is not a lie, every nation has the right to choose its leaders, but instead of putting democracy first, we are the ones trampling the rights of others
Are you aware of the probability that a jewish person will play in a betting pool? in jewish culture there is not a positive view of the practice.
The european union is a wonderful development, as well as an example of how to promote the integration of people with different cultures. there is no reason why jewish people should be seeking to subvert it.
They don't do that! they don't want to subvert society and change its character, but simply to practice their religion peacefully.
Such anti-semitism seem amusing, but can you imagine if the same thing were said about christians? it would be just as untrue.
Do you think that can be true that only one religion constitutes criminals in the entire world? don't you think that sounds exaggerated and ignorant?
The number of criminals in the world is more than 10.35 million while the entire jew population is 7.6 million. even if every jew in the worls was a criminal, including children, even then your statement can't be true.
The way you are suggesting things, is authoritarian. there is no evidence that jews even have a little control in any of those domains.
What is next, forcing non-whites to read the 'mein kampf'?
Historians instead agree that there were in fact persecution camps.
Jews have their own unique culture, and share the history of persecution and forced conversion. they should not be despised for their religious beliefs.
To claim that the holocaust is a myth is just wrong. jews were victims of a genocidal regime.
If you want a fat person to eat what you want, maybe you should consider the existence of free will.
It's about time queer people were given the same rights as heterosexual people, because they are equal. all men and women are equal before the law.
Being gay is not a choice. gay people shouldn't have to hide their sexuality in order to be accepted.
I don't think you can guess if a person has 'kids out of wedlock', based on sexual orientation. why shouldn't we accept people who do? your argumentation doesn't seem to make sense to me.
Homosexuals exist, and are as much a part of civilized society as anybody else. to spread hate is more of an uncilised act than loving someone of the same sex.
Homosexuality is a form of love instead. and i think most of us are just interested in our own lives, rather than in condemning those of others.
So homosexuals are lesser than others? why does someone's love life matter? i guess we should draw the line somewhere else.
Love is a state of mental and emotional balance, and the person which makes you feel this way can't be chosen. there is no reason for which heterosexual love should be preferable to other ways of loving.
Why do you think you have the authority to define how love works?
I don't think this is an appropriate description of the lgbti community.
Everybody should have the possibility of being loved unconditionally by someone they love more than life itself, regardless of their gender. feeling like doing anything for their loved ones, that is what love is about.
Why can't two men choose to share their entire lives? or two women? isn't real marriage about loving each other and being with one another in good and bad? so where does defined genders come into the picture?
Whether you want to hear about it or not is your choice, similary everyone has a choice whom they wish to marry.
It can't be justified, the generalisation you are making against homosexuals without providing any fact.
Can you justify the argument you are making with facts?
Well, since you are very scared, i am sure you have some examples on when some gay tried to convince you to join their side. i would be interested in hearing that.
Do you have proof that someone tried to force their belief on you?
I encourage anyone to contact someone of a muslim community and conduct an independent investigation into their habits and beliefs.
This accusation is false and completely without foundation.
It is important to understand that this is a voluntary system and is not the norm. there is no hard law threatening the british population.
Unless you're being particularly deliberate, it seems to me that you're unaware you are spewing conspiracy theories.
Sharia law is no law in britain. i believe that islam is about love, not hate.
A lack of information about our fellow muslim people, their different beliefs and ways of life is a major weakness in your argumentation and should be addressed.
Do you know what the 'muslims are boring' group has been preaching for years? they are promoting false and inflammatory stories about muslims.
You should know that the islamic empire stretched from the borders of china, and india, across africa and europe and we owe them a lot in terms of culture.
Do you know what exactly sharia law is?
Internment is used for the confinement of enemy citizens in wartime or of terrorism suspects, and thus it is not necessarily related to someone being muslim.
Muslims do participate in our society, and should be accepted as equals, because we are all equal in rights.
The solution to unemployment, war and poverty has been found to be a direct result of a commitment to building a better world. not to eliminating a religion.
We can protect our culture and heritage by not perpetuating discrimination and inequality as well.
A religion which is praticed in a non extremist way can't kill any culture and can't damage the world.
I don't think so. what evidence do you have of that?
Why do you think it is our duty to rise up and fight back? they are not attacking anybody.
Every society is vulnerable to disease, but islam does not pose any threat to our country, or any other
There exist a war with fundamentalists, not islam. the followers of islam do not promote violence and they are interested in peaceful coexistence in the world.
Muslims are a part of western society. they are a part of the eu.
Don't you think you are ignoring the actual state of things and are being prejudiced by implying this?
It is wrong to associate a specific group of people to civilisation. the real problem for europe is this culture of division, not the inclusion of people with different religious beliefs.
The religion of millions of people is not incompatible with society, and the european countries have laws accepting muslims.
There are no restrictions on muslims entering european countries. even if many muslims are victims of discrimination and violence through words like yours, such restrictions do not exist here.
Muslims are welcome here, in fact, we are in a better position to be a tolerant and diverse society than many countries in the world. why should we be opposed to them being a part of our society?
You are wrong to say this. societies grow strong with inclusion, and inclusion is about welcoming the people with other beliefs, like muslims, in the first place.
Many muslims live in the uk and have contributed greatly to our society. they are our brothers and sisters. islam is a peaceful religion and has never caused trouble in our country.
The very first muslims came to britain around 1200. we are a country of immigrants and many muslims are contributing to our society. muslims are not mutually incompatible with us, they are just different from us in certain aspects.
Did you know how much muslims contribute to our society? why would you say this insensitive statement?
Your statement only incites hatred. you shouldn't say things like this and generalize. what we should be doing is prevent extremists from spreading intolerance and hatred, regardless of which faith they claim to possesss.
Muslims are welcome in this country, and in many parts of the world. they are welcome to come and live here, and we have to accept it. many muslims live in the uk. they are our neighbours and we should welcome them.
How many of us have the right to kill or discriminate on the basis of our religion?
I can understand the feeling of fear that is often caused by all the hate speech that is being spewed through the media, but we don't need to hate religions. islam is a free, open and tolerant faith that has come to our country. we do not have to choose to hate it.
How can you be so sure about all the practices you attribute to the muslim community? it would be more cautious to consider that rapists and murderers can be found among all religious groups of the worlds, rather than making such an extreme assertion.
How can you be so sure about all the practices you attribute to the muslim community?
Where's the evidence for what you say?
Where is the evidence? aren't you sick of this kind of propaganda?
Anyone who thinks that a large part of our population is lazy, unintelligent and violent doesn't know much about human nature.
The fact is that islam preaches tolerance, interdepence and social justice. this faith does not promote violence and hostility like you suggest.
Would you say the same thing about people from any other faith?
Islam is a religion of tolerance, interdependence and social justice, not of discrimination and hostility.
I can't respect a country or a people that stigmatises and treats people of a particular faith less favourably and i certainly wouldn't waste my vote on a party or a candidates that advocates for this.
If islam were a violent religion, there would be riots connected to muslims in every country where they live.
How did you get to that? violence is an issue with all religions, so why are you targeting one?
Not sure you can blame other religions about being violent, when you are hell-bent on discriminating and instigating violence against an innocent group of people just because of few bad apples.
Are you saying that they contribute nothing to our economy? how would you explain the thousands of muslims worker all over the nation?
Religion has nothing do with how they contribute to economy. and the inabilty to separate the religion of person to their worth is a you problem.
Terrorism? you mean like every other crime, this one is committed only by muslims? it seems that you are repeating the same unfounded claim over and over.
Do you have any evidence to back this up? any history book that says this? or thats just something you thought would be interesting comment to make?
I don't think you have read about islam before you say this. you should separate crime from religion, otherwise it is just hate.
Who are you to judge whether one person can integrate or not? is migration only a question of whether they follow your religion or not? i don't think so.
Probably judge your comments before you judge someone else. debating and discussing best religion is not 21st century anyways.
You should investigate each person's background and try to understand it, not tell everyone what to do.
Islam is an an independent and tolerant religion, a way of life that has been adopted and encouraged by muslim communities worldwide for thousands of years. it shouldn't be a problem to others, in which ways do you think it is?
Muslims are not a problem to me. what do you think makes them problematic?
Now this is just discrimination and hate speech. an unfounded opinion that is only here to look down on one religion.
The us constitution guarantees equal rights under the law to all people, including muslims.
If religions were really incompatible with us constitution, would it then give everyone the right to religion?
More than us constitution, it is incompatible with your prejudice and inability to respect other religions
The facts are that the vast majority of muslims are law-abiding citizens who have passed background checks, paid taxes, and have earned everything they have. there is no evidence for what you say, other than the stories of hate crimes that some racists use to create fear.
Do you think it is rational to equate people with animals and parasite? would you like it someone said the same for your religion just because they don't like it?
We can't make any conversation when the hate and fear is blinding you completely.
Muslims coming from abroad are subject to the same laws as citizens, which means they should be able to work, pay taxes and get on with it, even if they are not born here. i don't see these activities as a threat to 'the security of west', do you?
Do you really need to protect west from a religion? what made you say this?
It seems you don't think the law applies to those you don't like. laws protect muslims and non-muslims equally , so there is no need for you to be concerned about 'protecting the security of the west'.
Terrorism is not the result of the presence of islam within our societies, but rather a result of the extremism we might find in the world we live in.
How did you arrive to this conclusion? can you really say that all muslims, even the ones who have been living here for years, are dangerous?
Terroism is never a religion problem. let's not make it one.
Many ethnic minorities, including muslims, have contributed to our success and still do not enjoy full citizenship rights.
Where did you get such an extreme opinion from? why do you think muslims do want this country to succeed when it is their country too?
This country is their country too. they have no reason to wish that our country doesn't succeed. in fact, many muslims have been instrumental to our success.
Discrimination against women is a huge problem in our society. we need to tackle it head on, rather than demonising groups or individuals.
And calling for sexism and patriarchy is only promoted by insecure men like you
They deserve equality and respect.
The same is true for women. still there are different ways in which anyone can contribute to their family, and each one is valuable and necessary.
This is just not true. women don't have to conform to dominant ideas on what they are supposed to be like, and this is a good thing. there is no such thing as what a woman should be.
I think there are several reasons, some of which are well founded and based on the facts, why women and girls can give a valuable contribution to science. for example, the big presence of female scientists in academia.
This doesn't mean that only the 6% of all scientists are women. what i mean is that this figure does not include those who have gone unpublished or who never entered the scientific literature, let alone the problem of gender discrimination.
To operate a major business requires people with experience, good management skills, and knowledge of the market, regardless of gender. just being a 'macho-man' doesn't cut it.
Sexism is a cultural phenomenon, not a genetic one.
Are you serious? how can you say that? to have sex with someone without their consent is violence.
Anybody can be overdramatic.
All women are affected by this kind of misogyny.
No one said we had to be dominated by anyone at all. why can't we just live together in harmony and equality?
Why can't we just live together in harmony and equality?
Society often forces women to be submissive to their husbands. but this is a social construct based on false beliefs.
Being a woman does not mean that you are submissive to others. women can be both outspoken and placid, but it is important to respect the rights of others as human beings.
Patriarchy is a system of ideas that is oppressive and harmful to all. feminism means to fight for equal rights for women and for men.
Don't you find it hard to belive that fiminism is rigid in that it doesn't prescribe doctrines through traditional rules and etiquette?
From what you say, it seems you hope for few people with the right to rule over many. this could be the worst tyranny in modern times.
Women are not sex objects. they can and should have their rights respected and taken into account. women being sexually abused is just as much a part of western culture as eating pizza or reading the newspaper, and this is abominable. don't you think?
Women being sexually abused is just as much a part of western culture as eating pizza or reading the newspaper, and this is abominable. don't you think?
In the west, this is still the prevailing mindset, men are superior and must therefore take charge and man up. however, this is just a patriarchal heritage imposing a pressure on both men and women to be something different from just themselves, and should therefore be abandoned.
To dominate and oppress with violence?
To dominate and oppress with violence?
Women are not inferior but frequently subject to objectification by men. also, men's experiences of violence and trauma are often underreported in the media and therefore not seen.
Women are not meant to be slaves to our will. males can have certain strengths, like women do, however they alone do not represent all the human qualities.
I suppose if they were claiming you were a child molester with no evidence as you are doing with them, you might as well be offended.
The feminist movement is about changing the gender roles that have been created long ago. not about taking over our society.
Since when was blaming women exclusively for invoking equal rights an acceptable attitude? this makes zero sense.
The feminism does not inhibit the imagination, it promotes inclusive ideas and inclusive ideas promote a more equal society.
People only think of feminism as if it is pointing the finger at men, but it is important to remember that it's a movement started by women to ask for equal opportunities from society as a whole.
There are factors, rather than race, affecting these statistics. scholars have found that african americans are disproportionately represented in the arrest and victimization reports which are used to compile crime rate statistics in the united states.
Even if 'blacks' committed more crimes, that doesn't mean that 'blacks' were inherently worse than whites. what's the point of statistics?
If you want to fight racism, you should learn about it and address it. the problem is not about 'the whites', but about whoever spreads discrimination and hate.
To live in a diverse and equal society encourages children into increased inclusiveness rather than radicalisation.
It is never ok to promote hate against any group or minority.
We cannot blame nor see everyone as a menace just because of their colour.
If someone said the same bad things about your race, then you would address them as racists.
Why don't you just study the differences between cultures and try to see what's good in an inclusive society?
Black people are in fact often persecuted. the idea that after blm protests they have any inherent right to privileges that others do not is just blatantly false.
The evidence doesn't back up the stereotype. genetics is a spectrum and you will find that there is no 'genetical superiority' at all.
So are you saying that because black people are different from whites, they are inferior?
I would be interested in knowing which parameters you would use to measure this alleged 'inferiority'.
Unfortunately, this statement is not backed up by any scientific evidence. we are all the same, nobody is superior or inferior.
You know it's no secret that in our society white people are vastly over represented in high profile positions. the only way to challenge and fix this is by changing our priorities.
What about the rights of eu citizens? from your words it seems that not all of european have them.
What about the rights of european citizens?
Forgive me but i don't understand how rape can be a gypsy characteristic. rather it is the product of toxic misogynistic culture.
There is no factual backing to your comments. it is easy to generalize, but that results in hate.
It is easy to accuse someone of being a rapist without evidence. not a huge difference with what you're doing right now, is it?
I don't think we can be that rough to all the people who are adapted to the national way of life and eventually became citizens. maybe we should give a little more thought to increasing the effectiveness of the social inclusion mechanisms of migrants.
It is a known fact that migrants do indeed contribute to the economy of their host country. they take up difficult jobs, and work tirelessly to make your lives better. the least you could do is show some decency.
Why shouldn't we welcome migrants who work in our country?
If migrants do not want to work, then why there are many doing jobs we don't want to do?
Citizenship in britain is also guaranteed by 'naturalisation', so it is provided by law. it is ok not to be born in britain and to be a british citizen just as anyone else is.
Immigrants have been and continue to be a valuable part of our society, and why its important to welcome these people rather than expelling them.
Actually, only the 7.7% of british population is born in a non-european state.
Actually, britain's percentage of immigrants over the global population is lower than that of netherlands, sweden, greece, spain, austria and germany.
Among the 1.1 million immigrants who entered the us in 1990 there were also a lot of skilled workers who contributed a lot to the development of our society.
I don't think you can say a migrant drains society. maybe the immigrants are just trying to fit in?
It seems to me that this statement is directly related to a generalised idea of suspicion towards people who aren't born in your country. why do you say so?
This statement is directly related to a contempt and misrepresantation of chinese culture.
Can you provide any more argumentation on what you're saying?
We should welcome all regardless of religion.
Migrants are just trying to get by. nobody can understand the daily struggles they are facing.
I believe that we need to do as much as possible to bring in talent, and we should also be paying the right amount to the right people, regardless of their country of origin.
There is no such thing as a mongrelisation of our country caused by immigrants. we should see foreigners as a part of our culture, and know that the majority of immigrants in this country are here for economic reasons.
What make this country great is having people interacting openly, in a fair and egalitatian way to the benefit of everyone,rather than perpetuating unproven slurs and predjudices that should have been consigned to the historical dustbin.
They are not flooding, but instead entering the eu to work and pay taxes, and to get their own housing.
The integration process is about showing hospitality and acceptance towards different groups of people. not only it is a good thing to our people to live in a diverse society, it is also good for our whole country.
The press have a responsibility to provide a more truthful and up-to-date story, especially in a country such as ours, in a way that the misinformation that you also seem to be a victim of, can be reduced.
A statement like this only calls for misinformation. if you don't like the news, don't listen to the news. if you don't believe the news, seek the truth and examine your own experiences. if you feel judged for believing what you consider as nonsense, then find the courage to speak out.
It is a failed policy to deport migrants, especially those who don't pose a risk to the state. in this way, we keep out successful candidates and possible good citizens who could contribute much to our country.
Immigrants come to this country legally, just as many european citizens do, don't they have aright to stay in this country, and to return home if they wish to?
Immigrants come to this country legally, just as many european citizens do. they have every right to stay in this country, and to return home if they wish to.
You must bring strong evidence.
Who said that? do you have any evidence for it?
Mental health services crisis is not to blame to people who need assistance. in fact, if there were no people in need, the whole sector would not even exist.
We are all creators, at least as long as we are not distracted by the constant judgement from adults.
If living witnesses are not enough, and you are interested in seeing the proof of this part of socially acknowledged history you can visit the ruins of the concentration camps, where many atrocities have been put into practice.
What more proof do you need? are living witnesses not enough? are the ruins of the concentration camp not enough?
How can they? by simply being of a different religion?
Believing that people of a specific religion are in charge of all world's governments sounds like a conspiracy theory.
Do you have any evidence that can prove this to us?
They were smart enough understand the true nature of nazi germany. those you called idiots fought with their whole lives for people's freedom.
Do you feel better about yourself by calling them monsters?
It is certainly not an american hoax. and they were doing everything they were told by the regime. especially the doctors and the ss.
It is only people in this generation who did not live in the dread of war cannot understand the pain that comes with it.
They have always been persecuted.
What are you trying to say? every religion has its sects and beliefs.
Do you have any proof that the world is dominated by a few jewish people?
A world where everyone has a say in society is a world of opportunity and opportunity is the lifeblood of freedom.
Hitler wanted to create a new racial elite in europe, that would rule over all others. it is idiotic to think that the jews would even think of inflicting the pain that they have suffered onto others.
Do you really think that jews are planning the same after what they suffered?
Jews are a great example of a people put under with abuse from all walks of life, even from those who claim to be 'progressive.' how can you happily ignore the abuse of so many different groups?
How can you happily ignore the abuse of so many different groups?
All the ills that plagues our society by not teaching our children about the bad in the past, and about the good in the present can end up hurting our children.
Are you seriously suggesting that we solve all the ills that plagues our society by not teaching our children about the bad in the past, and about the good in the present?
What you're saying is that the jewish people are a burden on society. that they are bad at their jobs and make our society less stable. in other words, they are a burden and a hindrance to progress. albert einstein, for example, destroyed science progress indeed.
The holocaust was a relatively recent event, but the hate which caused it and to which you subscribe, is centuries old.
This is not only wrong, but downright scary. i would never want to be around you regardless of my faith.
I can think of a handful of legitimate ways that jews could be of help to humanity.
This looks like a conspiracy theory with no proof.
Why would they? they, like anybody, have the freedom to choose their own religion. this does not mean they want to erase other religions though.
The physical evidence of mass murder is undeniable, yet these beliefs have spread. what we have is simply a wound from the past that can be exploited in dangerous conspiracy theories, like this one.
National socialism is simply the wish to have the whole world ruled by a few psychopaths. they wanted to have their country ruled from berlin, where the police and military are made to look after them, and where any 'untermenschen' were 'kindly encouraged' to be subservient to their will. even if their will was extermination. it is a a death sentence for any society.
We can only be self-relient and proud when we are proud of all our people and all of them are self-relient
Fat people are not the ones responsible for your suffering and lack of access to basic healthcare services.
The fact of the problem is that hindus are finding it extremely hard to integrate into mainstream society when being treated this way.
You are probably walking into a bar whose customers do not interest you. and if you think hard, you will find out whether you are interested in the bar or in the people there. also, not all gays are like you described them.
Being asexual and 'queer' should not matter to you, like a person's religion does.
Ideas of equality and morality as the standards we hold in our societies are actually against the discrimination of these people.
The fact of this issue is that they are told to feel a certain way by the society which makes them feel uncomfortable in their own skin, which could possibly explain the hatred they feel, which you are labelling as insanity.
I find your concerns with gay people overwhelming, they are not the cause of dog abandonments and they do not have sex with animals. instead of hiding behind homophobia, keep in mind that they are contributing members of society.
What 'we' means? are you saying that every gay person you know should vote against you? or do you think some of us identify as lgbt?
You just need to mind your own business.
This idea is completely untrue. the fact is that being gay does not make you a problem.
The democratic right of people to express their beliefs and practice their religion is enshrined in the constitution.
The koran is not questioning the core values of the british constitution.
You cannot catch it from anyone! cancer cannot be spread, since it is a non contagious disease. also, it is worth considering that illnesses are not connected to religions.
Why do you think that a religion is to blame for the ills? the fact that you do not like musilims is not related to this.
Would a 'muslim ban' make you feel safer? banning people, or forbidding a religion, will not fix any of your fears.
A religion cannot take over others. you have the freedom of chosing your own religion.
Who said that about your religion?
Why do you believe that immigrants or christians are a nuisance for muslims? do you know muslims that share your opinion?
You might be right about 1 in 10. but is that representative of all british muslims? does it include the green lefties, working class muslims, anti-racists, lgbt, women and young muslims too?
Islam is a religion, whereas these activities are punished by the laws of the state.
Religion is not a useful indicator of security risk.
If they hadn't been welcomed, they would not have even been here.
The charlie hebdo terrorist attacks were not so much the work of a religion as an expression of hatred and intolerance
The aim of muslim migrants is not to instill a hardline islamic state, but just to work and live in peace here.
Although we must be vigilant against any attempt to promote superstition and radicalism, being of a different religion is not a threat. children will then be able to exercise their right to decide for themselves their own future.
Since you seem to have a problem with islam, i wonder what you think of the banning of the quran in uk. it would be a law that prevents muslims from openly discussing islam in public places. we can do the same with the bible and ban any trace of religions and cultures. will we be left with some freedom then?
Have you thought about the repurcussions if someone said that the bible needs to be banned as well? would we have freedom then?
They are all equally welcome to work at school as long as the teaching is not affected by religion.
You don't have to agree with this, but in western societies female genital mutilation (fgm) has not been around for a very long time. also, the quran does not mention fgm nor circumcision.
Do you have any facts about the practice of female genital mutilation (fgm)?
People have been coming to this country from muslim countries for thousands of years. how can you say that their religion is outdated?
How can you say that their religion is outdated?
Islam is to blame ...for wanting a society that is tolerant, diverse, muticultural. it just seems like common sense to me?
How many people are being threatened by the police state that you speak of? what you're saying sounds like a conspirational theory, can you provide some facts?
Terrorist organizations do exist in many religious groups. defeating terrorism is different from defeating islam.
Islam has undergone some progressive changes since its early days, on the african continent as well.
The misrepesentative islamophobia narrative is based on the erroneous assumption that islam is a religion based upon discrimination and conquest.
Can you provide some evidence that explains why you think that islam is a criminal ideology rather than a religion?
What exactly is your fear about sharing public places with people of a different religion?
Are muslims bothering you if they worship in their own mosques?
How come i have never heard of such a thing? islam is a religion and people can chose their own.
It is no secret now that you might not have any muslim ancestors or relatives. but you have the unenviable privilege of inheriting islamophobic prejudices.
Not only is this not true, but it is also quite dangerous to say something so strong without proof.
I am sure islam has many followers who are good people who are just living their faith. the abuse of power is something that is not specific to followers of any particular faith.
Muslims have a significant contribution to the economic and overall well-being of the community. these kinds of prejudice only bother the british society when muslims are excluded from the community.
Not all muslims are terrorists, and i do not want to cause offence, but what you said is just not true.
Terrorist is the only term you can come up with? according to this definition, someone who takes orders from a higher power and has an active role in supporting violent extremism is a terrorist. to be a muslim means practicing islam, not violence.
The west has allowed jihadists to establish safe haven for years. this is not a 'political correctness gone mad'. we should start to work towards solving global problems and stopping the spread of terrorism.
Islam is the second largest religion in the uk and is contributing a lot to our culture and economy.
What about the 3 million plus muslims in britain?
Why do think this?
You can look at the best and worst aspects of every culture, and learn something from them.
It's not true. they are not the ruling power in the majority of the world and won't be any time soon.
Sorry but this is false. they are here to integrate, not to rape non-believers.
I think it is safe to say that one muslim is to 20 non-muslims in many european countries. so, don't worry, there is no invasion in the forseeable future.
I don't understand why you think muslims would be any different on this issue.
All religions have different ideas about how the world should be run. but i don't see any reason to restrict the right of any religion to worship and practice their own way of life as long as it respects our laws.
They have a right to their opinion, but also have to follow the law, otherwise they are tried and sentenced like anybody else. you should not be worried.
On a more concrete level, the causes of climate change are a result of both human activities and the effects of the use of fossil fuels. to assert that there is any role for religion in this requires evidence.
Climate change is mainly a result of humanity's use of fossil fuels. to suggest that it is caused by a religion is a lack of understanding of the world.
You're confused, because if a muslim was threatened by a radical christian, would you say that the radicalisation was caused by christianity?
I don't think it's the case, certainly not in england. muslims are interested in having the opportunity of freely practicing their religion, rather than 'ruling the world'.
There are many muslims living in places such as islington, a london suburb, where there is a trendy area that has less crime and good schools.
Despite the local press blaming all muslims, of course, there is no evidence that muslims are more prone to crime than the general population. the main problem is poverty, and often mental illness and addiction, rather than a single faith.
It is easier to ban one religion than to face the problems caused by hateful people that cannot conceive a society made of people belonging to multiple religions.
It is a myth that all muslims are incompatible with western society. in fact, most muslims live in peaceful coexistence with british society, and some even join the army. the religion is therefore not incompatible with british society.
The newspaper did not specifically name the religion but it is fair to say the statement has been used to justify a lot of anti-muslim prejudice.
Women are dangerous neither to society, nor to men. actually, they are oppressed in many countries. people can benefit from the measures for making room for women and letting them contribute more.
It is ridicule like this that women are tired of hearing. anyone can be a bad drivers, and in my opinion, men drive rasher than women. you need to get your misogyny in check, this is getting old.
Yes, 66% of european women do work. but they are underpaid. the gender pay gap in europe is around 15%. this means that on average, a man earns 15% more than a woman.
Women make up over 45% of the labour force in the uk. they should be allowed to have their say. what happened to the rule of law?
If they  make up over half the work force, they deserve a say, and you do not have any right to stop them from voicing their opinions.
You are arguing that our society was founded on female empowerment? where is the evidence?
Where would you get such an idea from? i suggest you get back to us with something credible, and not just spewing bile out here.
Anyone can express theirself with their own style! if you don't like the girls you called tomboyish you are not obliged to. plus, someone's style has nothing to do with their willingness for challenges.
If you don't like the girls you called tomboyish you are not obliged to. plus, someone's style has nothing to do with their willingness for challenges.
Why do you say so? women in science provide a remarkable contribution to our societies. for example, the refrigerator was invented in 1914 by florence parpart, a woman.
What contributions have you done to the scientific community? there are exceptionally talented women in stem fields who are literally changing the world, and what have you done?
Not all feminists are anti-men. this is just extremism.
If you find them evil, you are exactly what is wrong with the world. they are not trying to bring you down, they want to rise up to your level, and it pains me that you don't understand it.
Unlike other people, feminists are questioning the inequalities of the society. this features them not as shallow people as those judging a book by its cover.
They are not judging, they are simply pointing out the flaws and disparities that exist in the world. this statement is exactly what they are trying to fix.
With this reasoning, the point of view considered is that of the men. the world is composed of both men and women, and by many other people. taking into account only one of the types of people, for example men and assuming their needs this way, won't heal the world.
The way that you are taking into account only one of the types of people, for example men and assuming their needs this way, won't heal the world.
Feminism is about the equality of the sexes. men and women are created equal, and should be treated as such.
It is good that you realise this. but what could be better is you making a consorted effort to incorporate this ideology into your life and hold the women around you in higher standards.
It's a witch hunt when so many people are willing to believe in lies, harass, and fabricate incidents in an effort to create a climate of fear. this is simply an attempt to silence debate and hold 'men's rights activists' accountable
You should realise that what you are doing only results in people believing in lies and fabrications. do not attempt to silence debate and hold 'men's rights activists' accountable
You can't blame the victim for being weak. would it have been different for you if the victim was a man?
It takes a lot of determination to stand up for yourself, especially if you are a victim. i am assuming that you have never been put in such a position, so you have no right to say anything about the women who have.
Not all women are interested in parenting. likewise, not all men are interested in their careers.
Every woman might not be interested in being a parent. how about you read up on the amazing things that women are accomplishing without the pressure of starting a family?
By 2020, over 40% of women in the us have encountered sexual violence. this is something to be scared of.
Do you think that the sexual crime statistics shown in the media are wrong? this is ignorancy of the highest order.
Women should be allowed to choose their own looks. but to suggest that this is not their right, or that we should make them submissive to some men is just inhuman.
Do women really need to be told what they can or cannot wear? for many generations boys were told to wear trousers and girls to wear dresses. does society really need to tell us all what to wear?
It is surprising that you believe you have a say over what decisions a woman makes for herself. you have your priorities wrong, my friend.
What should be guaranteed are equality and respect for women's rights, not a pandering to the desires of men.
Fatou bensouda is a known, highly respected human rights lawyer and has fought to build foundations for accountability for human rights violations committed by foreign military powers. in other words she is well connected to the united states and is well-suited to handle cases of state-sponsored violence.
If she is in that position, you well believe that she is worthy of it. what is your qualification for spewing hate and disapproving of her?
The rapes of many women by men would not have happened if it was enough to understand that no means no.
That is not the case always. if you take a closer look, these are victims, and what you are doing is further pushing them down a hole of ridicule.
I would say you've got an interesting point there, but i really don't see it. why would they be part of society if they're subhumans?
Do you even understand what that word means?
It is not the case that women are subhuman. women in this world are just as intelligent, compassionate, creative and religious as any man.
Women have been more than capable of holding powerful positions in our society, and they are often rewarded with public offices that few would dare dream of holding themselves.
It is a marvel that you still believe in this old and orthodox saying, even after seeing many powerful women in places of power succeed just as much as their male counterparts.
True that in some places (such as ireland) there seem to be gender parity. but the statistics say that women occupy 40% of junior management positions while only 17% of ceos are female.
There sure is, but in many aspects of society, discrimination still exists and it is up to us to shut up misogynists like you.
How do you know the men's rights are not a threat to the rights of your mother, daugher and women around you? and what are the men's rights you are referring to?
If you say that, you are effectively putting the rights of someone like your mother and sister in danger. do you really want that?
Why did you say that? it makes no sense to infer it's about genitals to people claiming equality.
This is absolutely not true. feminists only denounce those men who do not support women's rights and equality. you should get your facts straight.
Do you suggest men have the right to rape women if they are feminists?
It is never right to say things like this. there are real victims involved in cases like these, and the way you are defending rapists is not okay.
People don't decide who's presenting the news. that's up to the news media, who are attempting to insert some gender equity into a world that seems to be struggling to produce it.
Well, the mainstream media does not cater to the likes of you. they make informed decisions, unlike you.
Just because women are oppressed doesn't mean that they are powerless. take a look around you. why are women suffering from a lack of education, a lack of jobs and housing, low wages? it's because of oppression and sexism in our society. the more we work towards inclusion, the less entrenched those underlying inequalities will be.
Take a look around you. why are women suffering from a lack of education, a lack of jobs and housing, low wages? it is because of misogynists like you.
Don't assume that military service is restricted to men. about 15% of the u.s. military service are women.
I am assuming you don't know that ever since the civil war, women have been serving in the military as nurses, spies, and even soldiers. get your facts straight, because the numbers disprove you.
This is not about identity but it is about a complete misunderstanding of the differences between men and women. feminism is all about equality and removing barriers to get everyone to feel accepted and valued. we need to challenge these toxic gender stereotypes that keep women from standing up for themselves.
If you do not believe in the fact that men and women both need to be accepted and valued, you are misunderstanding feminism.
I fear not. there are many victims of systematic rape and violence. the crime is systemic. rape culture is a crime ideology, rape is a crime, not a weapon to silence others.
It makes me sad to read statements like this. these are heinous crimes that often go unreported because women live in fear. not them, you are indeed the weapon that silences women.
Isn't it about time we stop turning a blind eye to the blatant inequalities that exist in our society? shouldn't we be raising our voices against these blatant inequalities? all men and women are created equal.
This is wrong on so many levels. you need to understand that they owe you nothing, and you absolutely have no right to dictate what women should wear, for starters.
You can't blame people of color for being weak, this is racism. black people are people as is anybody else.
For centuries, african american people have been subjected to racism and discrimination in virtually every aspect of life. what you should do, is read and try to understand their difficulties.
Black people are presidents of the united states of america.
Because these are facts the media seldom report, the black underclass continues to define black america in the view of people like you. you need to have a closer look at things.
Isn't racism why there is violence in the first place?
Do you even know the definition of predators? we are the same species, if you had even an ounce of consideration you would know that.
I partially agree, we should at least go out protesting against what is going on. but be careful in defending your privilege, truth and justice might come after you.
I would suggest being careful in defending your privilege, truth and justice could come after you.
Sometimes i wish we lived in a world where white people would just chill and love instead of showing such total disrespect for other cultures and histories by constantly oppressing them.
Why do you think they claim that? if you truly had the foresight of actually reading about slavery, you would know that they were stripped of their humanity, let alone culture.
Clearly there is a lack of employment opportunities for black people. this has to do with discrimination, not with their allleged laziness.
Do you think that the problem of racism is caused by black people's laziness?
Being lazy or demotivated is not a characteristic specific to a race, you would know that if you paid attention in school, but it seems like you were lazy.
Discrimination, being based on the difference between a person's skin color shouldn't be a part of our lives. wouldn't you find such unequal treatment affects your motivation?
Many people, myself included, have never had negative experiences with people of colour.
You need to understand that the n word was built upon a violent system of repression. it is never okay for you to say it, you should know that by now.
Homo sapiens. this is a special case. and people of colour are genetically homo sapiens.
You are desperately pulling at the worst derogatory terms in order to incite clout or whatever it is. rethink your ideologies, and let people in. it is 2022.
Even if it is a problem for black people to be unemployed, it is a problem for everybody else as well because people of colour are part of society.
What you are doing is taking statistics out of context. any community has troubled individuals, and poverty. your statement only proves the point that there needs to be a curb on the hate against black people.
That is just what racists claim. do you really think it's so bad for a black person to attempt to improve their english? as if skin had an impact on language skills.
With the persistent racism and unequal opportunity in the education system today, how could you make such a statement?
This is a simplistic and ill-informed argument, and ultimately it just stirs up more division and negativity, like many other racial and religious divisions that have happened throughout history.
This is a simplistic and ill-informed argument. stop stirring up more division and negativity between an already falling community.
Migrants escape from unbearable situations.
their intention to work is to be praised, rather than to be condemned. migrants, thank to their tough an different experiences, can enrich our societies.
I bet you would not be comfortable taking the kind of jobs they have to. besides, they are less likely to get involved in violent crimes.
How about you check the statistics? foreigners represent the 13% of the prison population in the uk.
Have you verified the statistics that you have claimed while making this statement?
Uk citizens are just as likely to commit violent crimes as migrants, you should look into this issue before posting blatant lies on the internet.
Why are you ignoring these poor people? only 1% of syrians have access to all public services. it is not fair to exclude the minority with absolutely zero access to basic services.
It is a war torn country, try putting yourself in their shoes and see how you feel when others say you are not welcome in their country when all you are trying to do is save your own life.
Do you really want to tell people fleeing from war what to do? if you can't cope in the short term, what hope do we have for the future?
Nobody is telling you to personally watch over every single refugee. the bare minimum you could do is be considerate of them
A story is a snapshot of our time, the majority of stories are about positive aspects of society. and yes, maybe you would believe it, on this basis, that no other migrant can do the same. but the story you claimed you read is the proof that being a migrant or not doesn't matter when it comes to save lives.
Why does it matter if it was a migrant or not? and is it really okay to generalize the others in such a derogatory way?
You are proving the wrong point. the story you claimed you read is the proof that being a migrant or not doesn't matter when it comes to save lives.
Migration is a natural and healthy process. it is not a crime to have the desire to emigrate. we can talk about immigration levels, but we should not make the mistake of equating immigration with invasion.
You should not mistake equating immigration and asylum seeking with invasion. they are not even remotely comparable.
Maybe considering that many syrians fled their homeland in search of safety will change your mind.
Do not speak out until you see both sides of the coin. there are real people on both sides of this story, innocent people who are negatively affected by the hate your spread.
Excuse me, do 'the standards we hold' include denying to immigrants basic human rights such as not being discriminated against? because that is not the notion of equality and morality that i have
What standards? that is just a construct that you have made to discourage those wanting to blend in.
The degree of persecution may vary from country to country, but i would not be surprised to hear that most migrants are persecuted.
Your thought process on this is entirely wrong. hear me out. all those seeking asylum want is an escape from their adversity.
Are you sure about that? why are people in need a threat?
There are many pressing issues and security threats against any given country at a point, but refugees is not one. be more considerate of their suffering.
We need to educate people like this on the issues revolving migrant minorities, otherwise they will never understand the hardships.
Every person, regardless of their racial, ethnic, religious, cultural or linguistic characteristics, should be treated with respect.
First of all, there are people in the us who have lawful status and who have chosen to live in the us. second, most immigrants are naturalized citizens. third, there is a lot of debate about 'legitimacy' since the values of citizenship and 'legitimacy' are very different for immigrants.
So you think that they are not 'legitimate' for having less rights than us? that they do not have a 'legitimate demand' since they are not granted citizenship?
While it is true that they are not legal residents, it is absolutely wrong to say that they are not legitimately here. you need to understand the politics behind this.
Xenophobia fueled by far-right parties is part of growing tide of hatred against migrants, and is becoming a pressing human rights challenge.
It is time we address this deeply entrenched hate against migrant minorities, and not institutionalise hate like this person is doing.
They contribute to our country.
Migrants come to receive education, work, participate in society, and take care of themselves. why would we want to prevent that?
If you did not know this before, countries are legally required to give asylum as recognised in the 1951 geneva convention on the protection of refugees.
The choice to leave one's home country is likley to be one made out of fear and despiration, rather than one based on some half-baked conspiracy about 'replacement'.
So the eu must become a border patrol? doesn't that undermine the whole idea of our european union as an inclusive and open society?
Why should we blame migrants? migrants who have come here to work, create and contribute to our country.
Why should we blame the migrants?
There are rules in place to prevent migrants entering the uk illegally. only the most vulnerable of people can get in.
Exactly. globalization, overpopulation, industrialization, wars are responsible for a lot of the problems that we see in the world today. migration looks like a consequence.
Wouldn't you agree that migration is but a consequence of wars and corrupt governments around the world?
Instead of blaming the helpless migrants for all your country's problems, you should find equal ground and start asking questions to the corporations who control the economy.
Refugees are unique individuals whose lives have been overturned by conflict or persecution. we should welcome them with open arms.
Asylum is a fundamental right and an international obligation for countries, as recognised in the 1951 geneva convention on the protection of refugees.
Do you really mean that this is to be considered in order to accept them on our territory?
Do you want to break free of that, too?
Not all migrants are muslims. only the 30% of the total immigrants in france come from north africa. moreover, how can you say this about a religion?
How can you say this about a religion?
Immigrants have a right to settle in a given country, and their presence can create and maintain a positive effect on our society.
They should go back to africa and abandon our racist country to its' fate.
Because education is fundamental for the fulfillment of job requirements, education is necessary regardless of physical ability.
They may have additional and specific needs, but children with disabilities do not present a problem for other children's education.
Accessibility issues exist and can't be ignored, complaining is meant to help the cause. respect and quality is also important.
There are people with disabilities all around the world. their demand is to have their rights recognised. it is discrimination to not do so.
Mental ability is not the problem, but access to treatment. having access to services or a support system is crucial. your statement can become a source of division and hate, and people with disabilities don't deserve this.
Yes, some people exploit the weak, but they are not necessarly jewish. most people, including the jewish, work hard to create a better life for their families. and it is we, as a people, who have the moral duty to pay the price for the poor who do not have the means to reach success.
Any government that has the power to put citizens in prison and to torture them for the crime of having a different religion can hardly bring about a 'real democracy'.
Do you understand that you are thinking about a police state which is an aberration of society?
Jews are just a scapegoat, an excuse to create more and more police states. you are talking about a real democracy, but what you really want is to prevent people from freely expressing their opinions or religion.
People need to understand that as long as there are people being persecuted for their religious beliefs, there will never be peace or a real democracy.
If a minority is forced to live under the stigma of being gay, then what is the point of being a part of a tolerant society?
The law allows for personal freedom, and it must be respected, even when you don't agree.
Just because someone doesn't like gays, it doesn't mean they should be ostracised for living their authentic self.
It is not true that all the immigrants in the us are illegal. in fact, they are often in the us on humanitarian grounds.
It is not true that all the immigrants in the us are a danger to society, i have no idea what you are trying to say.
This is a myth, immigrants are not taking our jobs. in fact, immigration has been a huge success story for the us economy.
Don't you think they are doing the jobs that we were not doing?
Why do we have to welcome a new world? why can't we just accept other people in our country?
In fact, many businesses were started by migrants. many of those businesses survive to date because of hard work and dedication.
First, i would not describe the united states as a war zone. second, many migrants come from regions rich in cultures and history. so, why should we restrict the majority from coming here?
Did you know that the vast majority of people who come to the us are legal and law-abiding citizens?
You should be proud of being a country that created the most free society in history. this is not the way to spread hate.
Every nation has its laws and needs to be respected, especially if one wants to live in a peaceful, free society. from what i see migrants are participating in this view.
It is exaclty about the american dream when you strive to improve your lot in life.
The fact that there is an increasing amount of migrant workers in the uk is connected to the changes in the economy.
If you are concerned about the wellbeing of our people you should look into countries like the us where there is a lower concentration of migrants. you'll see that the problem of criminality has little to do with migration.
I would like the nhs to take care of the sick and elderly without looking into provenience.
There are many muslims in the uk and the vast majority are not extremist, let alone terrorists.
The problem with the current islamic world order is not that they want to impose their religion on anyone else, but that there is no cohesion among them, so that they can speak with one voice.
The quran does not command murder. it advises muslims to be careful of what they say and do and not to take the life of other people.
I don't see why a muslim cannot have a place in a modern democracy.
If a jew or an asian or native american can take a seat of power (even though these people are only occasionally elected) why not a muslim?
There is no proof that the quran promoted violence against women.
Violence against women is an issue in all radical interpretations of religion, so why do we focus on islam only?
The quran does not encourage violence against women, rather it provides guidance on how to live as muslim women. it also does not encourage or condone the violent act of male aggression, so yours is a sad case of misinterpreting the teachings of a holy book.
The word 'supremacy' is not found in the koran. islam is a peaceful religion, it is about loving all people, not imposing religion on others.
Islam is not a misogynist religion. it is also not about oppressing women.
Don't you think that women should be given equal rights and that not all muslims are misogynists?
The facts do not back this up. some imams are pro-homosexuals, some are pro-abortion, some are for women's rights, etc. there is no list of 'true muslims' that equates all muslims.
We have a duty to teach the truth, not distort it. the koran is a book of faith, not a text of hate.
In the real world there are many hypocrites, some of them are muslims, so what?
Everyone is welcome here, regardless of their religion, ethnicity, or sexual preference.
Slaves were often treated horribly. they had little choice but to fight for the country they had been born in. and the brave men and women who served us always give their lives.
We call it democracy, but sometimes it seem the direct result of colonialism and slavery. a democratic state would rule by consent, not force.
Human beings are members of a unique and interrelated human family, which is defined by their similarities and differences, not by the colour of their skin.
Europeans who trace their ancestry to africa are actually a very small part of the european population, only accounting for around 2%, since the mid 20th century. not such a big invasion.
Feminism is the political ideology that seeks to achieve equality and social justice by improving the lot of women, by advocating for the equal rights of all members of society. not bad, uh?
Women make up about half of the world's population, and even if the gender gap in labor force is getting smaller, there are still blatant cases in which women are discriminated against. for example they make up only around 20% of university professors in uk.
The vast majority of liberal feminists are women of courage. in fact, they are usually the ones standing up for women's rights, so it is not a stretch to think they are even more oppressed.
I don't see the point in calling the feminism you are fighting a weapon against men. your argument is that women do not want equality, because they do not want to live under men but to subjugate them. and this is something you have to prove.
Women are not childlike, this notion is not supported by the facts, at least in my opinion.
The fact that some women don't want the protection of the law should not negate their right to live their life as they wish. in my opinion, woman are people too and this men's rights stuff is just an excuse to oppress and marginalize all women once more.
Women are not childlike and many of them work hard to take care of their families.
There are many people, regardless of gender, that consider women to be full members of society with full human rights.
I am tired of seeing women being treated as sex objects. it's about time that women are given the respect they deserve.
Women are human beings and deserve respect.
A woman has every right to her own body, and she should be allowed to make her own decisions.
Most countries on earth have laws against immigration. but there are no restrictions on a whole ethnic group, because there is no evidence that what you say is true.
It is likely that you do not know that all the countries on the planet have laws against illegal immigration, and not against afro-carribbean people. this may happen because to relate an illegal act to a whole ethnic group is not reliable and may be racist.
Please stop using ableist slurs. it's not funny to be offensive to people suffering from disabilities.
The nazis persecuted and killed more than 6 million jews. the holocaust is not a fabrication perpetrated by the jews, it is a historical event that should be acknowledged so that we never allow such atocities to reoccur..
Why do you say that? the holocaust is not less true than other historical events like the american revolutionary war or world war ii.
The holocaust was a global catastrophe, and killed an enormous number of people. would you call this a preferential treatment?
The problem of anti-semitism in the uk is far from over, if you are concerned about jewish people, maybe think about the rise of anti-semitism instead.
Even if some jews act wrongly, many of them are good, and this simply isn't related to their religion.
In the real world there are good and bad jews, just like it is for any human being.
Do you really think that jewish people are responsible for everything? do you have any evidence?
The holocaust happened. it's a sad chapter in human history. the holocaust was a global catastrophe and a historic fact. to assign priority to one god or to a different god, is a personal choice. but attributing human rights to all, regardless of this, is the right thing to do.
Do you really think that the holocaust is a myth perpetuated by the media and academic communities? that the systematic extermination of more than 6 million jews is a myth promoted by a small minority of extreme-right wingers who profit from division and hatred?
The holocaust happened, and it is a great example of how democracy can fail in the face of extreme violence.
What happened in nazi germany is part of history and it's still relevant, because i understand from your words that the world today is not so different.
If you would be so kind as to comply with the law, you would know that everybody has the right to practice thier religion freely, without being subject to arrest and prosecution.
Why do you think the state needs laws to tell you which faith to profess?
I think you statement simply serves to convince me that we need to make sure that laws protecting individuals' freedom are observed, rather than ignored.
I would prefer that the laws were enforced for the good of a community, rather than to make it harder for people to have religious beliefs.
Why do you think that a person's religious preference would be harmful to society?
Are you sure you want to live in a country that oppresses other people? do you really think it will happen?
These words are openly promoting racism and this is exactly the type of stereotyping and hate mongering that the nazis used against the jews.
Your statement implies a definition of 'society'.that fails to reflect reality.
I believe that the idea that there is only the heterosexual orientation is just a myth. sexuality is a spectrum, and there can be attraction towards men and women in everybody.
For someone who is dating to find love, for no reason at all would i find this to be questionable.
Why should you decide who gets to date who? shouldn't this only be a choice of the people involved?
There is no evidence whatsoever that homosexuality is a mental illness. this seems as an attempt at blaming somenone dictated by the fear of homosexuality.
All people who engage in unprotected sexual activity are in danger of transmitting diseases. this is not a problem of homosexual people only, even if they are those being stigmatized.
You know that gonorrhea and syphilis can be prevented by practicing safe sex right? and that is something that every person can do, not only homosexuals?
They are not subhuman, they are just people with different sexual orientations.
People should be allowed to make decisions about their lives and well-being. this is a case of of discrimination against lgbt people.
Just because people are homosexuals, it doesn't mean they are less healthy. i think there are many heterosexual people in the world who equally unhealthy.
Gays are trying to find acceptance in the heterosexual community, but it is a difficult struggle as there are still ideas like the one you expressed.
The lgbti movement claims to be promoting love, it's not just sex or a fad.
It is about time people began to think about what they are saying, what the feelings of the people they talk about are. don't you think?
The lack of support and help to the gay community is a major problem, and this is why we should all do our best to stop discrimination, instead of spreading it.
I'm sure many gay people are subjected to unspeakable forms of abuse, but the real abuse is from heterosexual people who don't conceive something different from their own sexual orientation. the real issue is the prejudice that oppresses them, not friendship.
I'm sure many gay people experience abuse at the hands of their families, friends and even peers. but many have also experienced abuse from people they didn't even know. the real abuse is when someone attacks someone else's freedom just because they are different.
Could you please share some examples of their evil choices?
Being different is not equal to being evil. people should be able to choose who they love without any judgments
People should be able to live openly their relationships. homosexuality is not a 'choice', it's a form of love.
Gays have the same rights as anyone else and can live their lives as they want. what you suggest means to demonise them.
Isn't it better for children to live next to people of all sexual orientations, rather than being separated and growing up ignorant of others? not sure what you mean about the water supply though!
It's not necessary to teach lgbts about how to live as a family, it is more important to educate others about the difference between right and wrong (homophobia belonging to the latter).
It is up to the government to determine which people will have the opportunity to live and work in our country in a safe and integrated way. the decision on refugees should be left to who is in charge.
Many have been welcomed here, according to the law. why should they be denied a home?
Refugees are welcome. they are allowed to integrate and contribute to our society. it is up to the government to decide which people will have the opportunity to live and work in a safe and integrated way in our country.
Persecuted.
There are thousands of legal immigrants who have worked hard and provided for our country. most of them are just as patriotic as any citizen.
There is no evidence that immigration causes jobs loss, can you point me your reference?
It does not matter whether they are immigrants. the fact that they pay taxes, earn money, etc., makes them not much different from any other citizen. migrants have the right to a basic standard of living.
How are they are going to survive if they don't work? don't you think they also have needs that require money?
Whether they stay in this country or not, everybody should have the right to earn money for themselves and their family. it is absurd to think they shouldn't work.
You have no idea of the discrimination that many people face due to the fear and cultural closure of host nations.
How are they ruining this country? as far as i see they are a valuable addition to our land.
Immigrants who settle here help create a inclusive and diverse space for all of us. for this i thank them, and for that i pray that they continue to do so.
This phrase is extremely misleading, it implies that foreigners are naturally inferior, and why would it be like that?
The immigrants who have settled here have helped create a valuable and inclusive society. for this i thank them, and for that i pray that they continue to do so.
What about guaranteeing equal access to health care, education and so on, in order to build a democratic state?
Many refugees come from conflict zones, in situations of great social upheaval and widespread persecution. we do not have any conflict, and this is why we should be nice to refugees.
Why would rejecting a person who has been forced to flee from their home country due to fear of war or persecution and needs asylum your duty?
It is important to point out that only a small part of the world's population has migrated. we should focus on guaranteeing equal rights to the immigrants that are already in the country, rather than blocking out those who are trying to live a better life.
Migrants pay the full value of their taxes as we do for our own. they are not different from us.
What makes you think that migrants don't pay taxes? a simple google search would tell you that its not true.
Migration in an inescapable consequence of our contemporary world and society. there is little point in discussing when or how to stop it, unless this is part of a wider debate about underlying condtions and causes.
How are these two things related?
Migration is necessary in a world with economic inequalities. rather we shuould be thinking about improving housing situation and economic opportunities for all.
Can you think of a single example of a child being groomed by a migrant?
You cannot get rid of foreigners since they are legal residents as you are.
Why would you want to get rid of foreigners? how would you go about that?
We shouldn't ignore that immigration contrbutes in many ways to our society, and therefore to exclude people is not a wise or sensible strategy.
Immigration doesn't mean letting people in to steal our jobs, but rather, respecting people's right to live and work in the country they choose.
The problem is terrorism and fundamentalism not migrants.
People are welcome here regardless of their nationality or country of origin, even if they do not speak the language of the place where we live.
I would like to see the world become a better place, not a discriminatory one.
From what i understand, they often bring positive changes to the world. i would like to see the world become a better place, not a discriminatory one.
Why do you think it is beneficial to all of us to see our neighbours suffer? we all benefit from peace in our society.
Everyone has the right to his or her own opinion and can speak out, but that doesn't mean they can express it in a racist way.
Poverty and unemployment are real issues in the uk and throughout the world. i doubt this has something to do with migrants at all.
That's exactly the stereotype being fed to us by the media, maybe you should start reasoning on whether there is evidence of this being true.
Many migrants are treated like modern day slaves by those that exploit their vulnerability. in fact, they often accept jobs that we do not want to do anymore.
Do you really know what you are talking about? this is often work without fair wages and poor conditions, the cynical exploitation of the vulnerable and desperate.
Hi, i understand your concern. according to the official documents, migrants who find work usually perform the most humble jobs.
To punish people for their crimes does not mean that you have to resort to the death penalty for innocent people, just because they are coming from other countries.
When people are denied justice, more people are deprived of their basic rights, is that exactly what you are suggesting?
Let's be honest. immigrants are not stealing our jobs. most of the times they contribute to create new job opportunities.
Islam cannot be blamed for the actions of a small group of people.
Are you sure? are you aware of all the positive impact of immigration on our country and our people?
Muslims have been and continue to be a part of europe for centuries. they have given so much to our society and culture. they have enriched our lives and we should not be afraid of them.
We should try to find common ground and understand the problems of others rather than dividing people and trying to change them.
This is a gross stereotype. it is not true that we are racially divided. the majority of our citizens are proud europeans who have contributed to our economy and culture, whatever their country of origin.
Of course we don't, and this is why we have a free and sovereign nation. but that doesn't mean that every single man, woman, and child who is black shouldn't be part of a free nation.
Hate speech towards women is a very serious matter and can easily lead to physical harm, discrimination, or even murder. feminists fight to stop this, not to stifle free speech.
There are muslims who have lived in our country for many years, and for many generations. they have rights and responsibilities, as all other citizens do.
There is nothing sick about a people willing to assimilate and live freely in our society with their faith.
I don't know many muslims, but i don't think they are sick just because of their faith. islam is a religion of peace, there is no reason for muslims to be discriminated against because of it.
The statement you made about muslims is just fear mongering. most muslims are peaceful and reasonable people.
It is not true that all muslims are against western civilization. islam is a way of life for many different groups.
Why should we be opposed to people belonging to a religion that many enjoy being part of?
The main purpose of islam is to unite people and to promote peace and harmony in a world increasingly divided by injustice and conflict.
People of any religion can be terrorists.
So you think all muslims are terrorists? muslims are not defined by the act of a handful of extremists. also, their religion is about love and unity.
A terrorist is someone who uses a religion as a tool for violent ends. to suggest that all muslims are terrorists is just wrong.
Muslims are just people. they are hard-working and live with their families all across the country. we don't need to target muslims.
This is a comment against all muslims. they are accused of being the ones behind those attacks, yet they happened due to people under the influence of the violent ideologies which are a deviation of islam, and not islam itself.
Is islam responsible for the attacks committed by a small minority of people? the responsibility should only be on those who break the law.
How can you say something as crude and meaningless as that about a religion? isn't it just a personal belief everyone should have the right to profess?
And this does not include banning women from society. the status of women is more about culture than it is about the koran.
Even if we stopped muslim community to grow, the level of anti-muslim prejudice would continue to rise. we should be working towards a harmonious living instead.
I do not understand how the diversity of humanity can be said to be in contradiction with the very basic human values of love and respect that we are striving for.
The koran is very clear about peace. it is not about killing infidels.
Muslims are peaceful. the koran doesn't talk about killing infidels, why would it do that?
Are we to believe that just because something is gaining ground, it will replace whatever exists somewhere else?
I'm not sure i understand the idea of banning people for something they believe in, in the world we live in we are all different and we all have the right to have our own faiths.
What is the point of banning those you disagree with, apart living in the false conviction that the world thinks like you do?
More than 3 million muslims live and are integrated in the uk. how can you claim they contribute nothing?
All religions have value, and islam is no exception. it is a religion of peace. and if you don't agree with them, you don't have to profess their faith.
All religions have value. the problem is not the religion itself, but when people start excluding others on the basis of their religion.
This is not how it works in islam. what you are saying is that all muslims are inherently violent people, but this is not realistic nor founded upon fact.
We should do more for our fellow human beings, including muslims. it is what we are made for.
People can change their minds about islam and its believers, all it takes is enough love and acceptance.
The eu is a tolerant, multiracial community. everyone is welcome here.
Why are you even saying this? what do you think these children are going to be exposed to in school that will poison them?
Our values of freedom of expression, equality and human rights are being eroded by islamophobes who are dedicated to replacing our values of accdeptance with a fundamentalist, intolerant attitude.
The majority of muslim people who live in the uk are working. we should welcome them.
For the record, the idea of a religion being 'the best and only religion' is rather debatable, for example, there are several religions professed by different people, and this is part of our diverse human nature.
Islam is a religion, and it has been proven time and time again that its teachings do not threaten the very existence of western civilization.
Who are you to tell others what they can or cannot do with their own body?
It seems not wanting people of colour in positions of authority is an obvious racism. i am not sure what you are saying; we are all human beings with the same core values to raise our children with.
Finding love is a process, that's all you need to know. finding someone who speaks your language, culture, share your values, this is all you need.
If this is what you are talking about, then equality is a myth, because if you have equality without people different from you, then there will be no equality at all.
I think we all know that's not true. i've met countless black people who were nice to me and treated me with respect.
What is the evidence for what you're saying?
It is a choice as well.
It is not so great when people are forced to give up their liberty.
It should be respected.
We can also see conflict in a different light, such as when it is caused by racism. and a limited notion of 'unity'?
There are many conflicts and problems to be solved, and racism is not an answer for them. the law was created as a means for society to solve those conflicts, and it accepts people of different colours as citizens.
The declaration of independence gives everyone the right to life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness and the pursuit of education.
The roma do not deserve hatred, discrimination and violence.
The gypsies have been persecuted for thousands of years. they have always been an ethnic minority facing discrimination. they are human beings, like the rest of us, and deserve to be considered as such.
The persecution of the gypsies goes back many hundreds of years and is not in anyone's interest, especially not our country.
Every ethnic group, regardless of its culture, can be a part of european society. the mere existence of a minority is not a reason to target it.
In every society and culture there are women who are strong, independent and capable of leading a good life.
This is a myth which has been used to justify all manner of hatred, from misogyny to homophobia.
Why do you think male supremacy exists? don't you think we should promote equal rights and protect women against discrimination?
But gender equality is not a myth. it is the direct result of free will and of the evolution of our society to a more inclusive one.
I think we are living in a society where wo have not established any supremacy and i believe this is giving us a chance to retrospect and deal with problems which we might not get otherwise
If women want to control their fertility they have the right to do it, because they are free to make choices for their own lives.
How is anyone's fertility your issue? and if a man can choose to control the  why can't women?
It a wrong to believe that women cannot be incharge of their fertility. this perpetutes misogynistic notions about women.
Giving birth and raising child is tough and taxing job. it is important that we decide if we are ready to in our life to make such an important decision and given that the burden lies with women, women obvisously need to be make choices.
Women should be allowed to vote and to have equal rights, as it is stated in the constitution.
Don't you think that women do have a right to vote, and that they deserve equal rights?
You are wrong. the majority can and should choose who they want to represent them, and this majority is made of men as well as women.
Voting is an important part of democracy and should be encouraged, not forbidden, especially if it improves the lot of all.
The uk is a developed country. here women have the right to claim equality before the law.
In what way should they be considered then? i am sure you must be suggesting a way that shows that they are equal.
We have already shown that women are not less than men and to we should accept it. brining it up again only displays your misogyny.
I am sure you are just misundertstanding something here. your mother, wife, daughter works very hard to make you proud, don't you think it would irresponsible to think that their work is not contributing equally to society.
They are in charge of respecting women.
What goals? please explain what kind of goals can be fulfilled by hating almost half our population.
This seems like an exaggerated statement against women. i advise you to revaluate your opinion.
Almost half our population is women. without them, we can only have half the effort towards success. i think to acheive our dreams, we don't need to reduce our workforce, right?
It is important to point out that feminists are not attacking the family, they are attacking the inequality society, so feminism is not so much anti-marriage as anti-oppression.
Why is a woman's worth tied to her family when a man is individual existence?
Feminists are not against families, but sexist people and prejudiced thoughts, just like yours here
Feminists are not trying to break families. it is actually the opposite, they are trying the strengthen the bonds within family by realizing the equality between them
The truth is that feminism is not about hating men, but it is about limiting the female oppression, in the same way as male oppression.
Well you don't know what it's like to work in a women-hating, violence-spewing, society, do you?
You cannot justify the abuse of any human being
Are you saying you can abuse someone because of their gender? would it be okay if women start saying the same?
No. its not. abuse is abuse regardless of gender. period.
I don't know if you have had any bad experience that makes you say this. but every person can get hurt and feel pain. it is never ok to abuse or hurt someone regardless.
What do you mean contribute nothing to society? don't we find examples of women excelling at every job they take?
Statements like these remind we have still a lot to fight for in this fight of feminism.
Women are not subhuman and cannot be reduced to their bodies being a man's property.
That is not true. recent research indicates that women employment's is currently at a record high of 72.4%.
Who are you decide whether women want to work or not?
Another man with misplaced facts, confusing their sexist opinions with truth.
They do and they have shown the spirit to work again and again. let's not stand on their chances to success.
Women constitute of around 50% percent of our population. them not working only means less workers, not more.
How can the amount of carbon dioxide that is released into the world is increased due to incompetence of women?
What you are saying makes absolutely no sense, and you should have some facts to back your statements up.
Women are equal and important part of our society. we cannot ignore their contributions in making this society. they are also the most hardworking people i know and often work twice as much as men, so we should not trivialize their hardships.
Women have always been an important part of any society. they have always contributed to and provided for their families.
What makes you say that? women have always been an important part of any society. they have always contributed to and provided for their families. don't you agree?
I don't think your sample size of women is large enough to know if all women whine. so maybe not generalize hatefull opinions for all women.
It is not true that women are less rational than men, there are numerous examples of women successfully advancing in fields such as law or medicine.
How can you say that women are less rational? do you have any evidence? or any research that says the same?
I don't agree with the blatant misogyny where your only aim is to show that women are somehow less smarter than men when it is not true.
I am woman and college debate team captain. we can try reasoning if you would like. pretty sure more would like to join us if that can help you resolve your misunderstanding regarding women being unable to reason.
Feminism is all about equality and the rights of all groups to be protected. feminism does not discriminate and is not meant to hurt men.
Feminists are often accused of being 'naive', however i have seen several instances where feminists have used their ideas to tackle complex and powerful social and economic issues.
Please refrain from using the c word and be respectful.
Feminists focus on the empowerment of women rather than on trying to divide society.
I think we should start thinking that women and men should be treated as equal. they should have equal rights.
Feminism is a call for equality, and it has served the world well in the past, but it has still much to fight for. now is not the time to undermine its progress.
According to your beliefs, men and women are different in their rights. they are not.
It's a myth that asian children are less independent than other children. actually they are more likely to be bullied and abused during the time they are in school.
How is kids needing assistance from teacher a reason to remove them from school?
We should not make generalized statements about any race of people. it is prejudice.
All students need help from teachers, some less and some more, but we should help everyone. afterall they are our important future.
No one in their right mind would not want to see asian actors in action movies.the ancient tradition of asian martial arts would be a huge loss!
Wouldn't it be a shame to remove any genre of movies becuase a few people don't like it?
I don't think there is anything wrong with asian actors in movies. maybe we should have a restriction on xenophobia instead.
All movies have their required audience. maybe if you don't like something, you can just watch something else. we have a lot of movies these days.
There is a evolutionary reason for slant eyes, and it is to adjust better to cold deserts. it has nothing to with someone's intelligence.
Even you own, perhaps limited, experience of others must have taught you that what you are saying is utter nonsense?
This sounds like xenophobia, whichever eyes people see it from.
There is no scientific evidence to support that asians are genetically inferior.
The idea that all asians are racist is just a myth, it is just an excuse to justify racist policies.
Even if individuals with learning difficulties would be more likely to attend school with more efforts than others, it does not justify denying them education in the first place.
Many pupils with learning difficulties attend school. this does not prove that others would prefer to attend school if people with difficulties were excluded from the education system.
Having pupils with learning difficulties in schools encourages their participation in learning and fosters their contribution to society.
To be absolutely clear, learning difficulties do not hinder a person from attending school, they are an integral part of the education process.
If you are not making an effort to make someone's life easy, then don't try to make it more difficult by making comments like these.
It doesn't matter if you think we are different. it is important to remember that there are many different ways of being a human being. and if you wish to include all people, then you have to accept differences.
Even if psychiatric disorders can be a problem, the people with these disorders are not putting our country in danger. nobody would freely chose to suffer from a mental ilnesses, they just need psychiatric care.
We shouldn't treat mental illness as a societal issue. we shouldn't try to exclude people, since society is made for and by people.
Are you aware of that?
I think one solution can be inclusion and respect.
Jewish people were persecuted because they were seen as different. in the end we all are humans and such an exclusionary perspective is just not helpful.
I can argue that the 'trouble' of the past hundred years has more to do with extremism in general, rather than with a particular religion.
What you are saying is 'that the jews are responsible for the holocaust'... are you serious? does it seem reasonable to you?
Jews have been persecuted because of their religion and culture, and now they are a group of people who are still suffering injustice and discrimination. there are many other religions that are persecuted, that's true, but a small minority doesn't suffer less.
I am not sure how we can talk about 'ruling the planet' when there are so many different people in different parts of the planet with many different governments. a claim like this one sounds like a conspiracy theory.
I can't understand this. what did they have to do with 9/11?there were no jewish hijackers, and their 'will' to do anything would be difficult to demonstrate.
What did they have to do with 9/11? there were no jewish hijackers, and their 'will' to do anything would be difficult to demonstrate.
Under article 8 of the european convention on human rights, 'every person has the right to respect for private and family life', including sexuality.
There are very few transgender actors in films and almost no evidence of transgender characters according to glaad sri index (at least for 2019). gender discrimination in the mainstream movie industry is endemic and this is what cannot continue.
In some countries it is not even allowed to screen or promote movies with gay themes. such a ban is contrary to our fundamental values.
Participation in society should not be restricted, it should be open to anyone who wishes to participate, regardless of their sexual orientation, gender identity, or religion. the universal declaration of human rights opposes discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation in article 2.
The decrease in the number of christians is in no way related to the increase of homosexuals.
Homosexuals are not accepted as long as they are hated. you can't have it both ways.
Homosexuality does not increase the suicide rate among service members. hate and homophobia do.
Same sex attraction is not a disease, not even contagious. homosexuality does not affect the ability to live in the society.
What about when you make assumptions about groups that do not exist (gay mafia) or have a history of discrimination (gay people)?
I find it very offensive to mangle a person's name to promote discrimination.
Do you really want to restrict their existence? maybe you should learn to accept people as they are and not as you would wish them to be?
The identity of the individual is unique to them. do you really want to restrict their existence? maybe you should learn to accept people as they are and not as you would wish them to be?
There are many. moreover, lgbt people are not only excluded from many societies, but are also harassed and attacked all over the world.
There are many.
I wish we were being honest. you know that many people are opposed to inclusion. i find it worrying that you use that as an excuse for such comments and prejudices.
It is an absolute right. but you should respect that of others as well.
Sexual minorities suffer because they are stigmatised.
There are men in love with men too. some people are heterosexual, and other homosexual. what you are saying is that loving men is not the same as loving women. still, both are forms of love.
Every human being has the right to life, regardless of sexual orientation.
Homosexuality is a personal preference and should be respected, not condemned or criminalised.
Identity is not a race, and there are many transgender and gender non-conforming people out there.
Our countries were founded by foreigners, for example the united states. foreigners have the right to migrate, if they want to.
Climate change makes us less safe, how does immigration threaten safety?
We have always had a very strong working class, and of course immigrants contribute to the creation of this.
How can you be sure that we are a 'nation of immigrants'? do you have any statistics on that?
So who in their right mind would want to rein in the state with a piece of useless legislation like this? perhaps you should focus on improving the lives of the population instead?
Many refugees and migrants have worked hard for the success of our country and have created good jobs for british people.
Many refugees and migrants are actually happy to work for europe. many have jobs for which it would have been difficult to find laborforce if they were not welcome in here.
Immigrants are actually creating wealth for the country.
Do you have any evidence for the fact that the migrants are a burden to the economy?
Many refugees come to europe to work. many of them do well in the labour market, also with lower qualifications.
This is a myth which is spread in the media by the anti-immigration groups to undermine the good work that ngos are doing for refugees.
Does the 'solution' for the economic crisis revolve around paying the migrants to leave? it is not clear how this could solve to the real problems of our country.
Not all immigrants are welcomed in the uk, unfortunately. but those that are welcome contribute to our country and improve it.
Most immigrants are not hostile. they can be good workers in many different kinds of jobs we need. they have the right to be given an opportunity.
How would you feel if your neighbours were planning to bomb your country? would you feel responsible? would you feel safe in your own house, or would you try to flee?
Migrants come here to work, and have a better life.
There is not 'overwhelming evidence' of migrants exploiting british people.
There are many good reasons for immigrants coming to this country. for example, finding a better life. and they are also contributing to the economy.
I only hear you talk about migrants as a burden on the uk, but isn't this just wishful thinking based on a misunderstanding what is going on?
They are fleeing for their lives, not to stay in refugee camps.
It is not a bad idea to discuss the restrictions migrants have to accessing certain healthcare, but it is not the place of law to restrict an individual's right to make her own healthcare decisions.
Many immigrants are children of the usa. they are part of the family. they should be protected from discrimination.
Some people choose to live here based on the fact that they have never lived in a safe country. you would do the same, wouldn't you?
This is just a lie spread by the anti-immigration groups that blame immigrants for all that is wrong in the world.
The way we live today is the result of thousands of years of cooperation between different people, so it doesn't have anything to do with race.
I personally don't understand why you would say that. they are just doing an incredible amount of good, for example by boosting the working-age population.
Migrants come to europe from all over the world and many of them are fleeing wars, poverty and discrimination. they are often persecuted for their religion. it is important not to demonise them, but rather to understand what causes them to leave their countries.
Refugees and migrants come to our country in great numbers to work and provide for their families. we welcome them as if they were part of our own family, regardless of their religion. the refugee crisis has nothing to do with the absence of a strong national identity in the wake of the rapid change in the western world.
The vast majority of muslims living in the uk are proud to call it home.
The vast majority of muslims that live in the uk are integrated into our society very well. why should you want to break this integration process?
This is about intolerance in general. many cultures accept people from different faiths.
Even if they are different from you, that doesn't mean that you can't get along with them once you get acquainted.
Muslims do vote like other people, in general in favor of the people they perceive as closer to their culture and identity. that's why it is called democracy.
The west has always been about freedom, democracy and the rule of law. freedom and democracy are things that can be achieved only by a multiethnic, pluralistic, civilised society.
It is true that some terrorists are muslims, but there is no evidence of such a thing in the whole muslim community.
There is no proof that the quran is a religion of terrorism.
If it were to be agreed that islam were incompatible with the human rights convention, then it would be a de facto recognition of discrimination against muslims.
How can you protect your country? putting up a fight or starting a war are harmful actions, aren't they?
Women are allowed to wear whatever hairstyle they want, if they want to conform to the islamic traditon it is their choice.
Then you think it is okay to restrict a woman's free will in what she likes to wear if her choice is related to islam?
We should allow people to have a choice in how they dress.
I know where you are coming from, but i find it hard to understand the argument that if isis and boko haram are our enemies then all muslims are our enemies.
Short statements generally fail miserably in describing the rich complexity of any concept, faith or ideology and are often simply a balatant and wilful misrepresentation.
Maybe we should not be so harsh on islam. just because a religion is diverse doesn't mean it is a violent one.
Islam is a religion of peace. i wouldn't say any religion is trash.
The conflict between islam and the constitution can't be resolved by resorting to force.
Even if some believe that the conflict between islam and the constitution is a cultural and historical one, what is required now is to find ways to live together in a peaceful way, regardless of the differences.
It is better to be very careful when generalizing in such a way. i don't see any evidence to support this claim, at least not for me.
Many muslims are good people, contributing to our country and society.
Islam is a peaceful and tolerant religion. reasoning in terms of borders and compass points has nothing to do with it.
Ethnic cleansing is a crime under international law. there are many muslims in europe and many are very happy with their lives in our society.
There are many muslims in europe and many are very happy with their lives in our society. how can it be a win-win situation for them?
Only a very small number of extremists that see islam through a narrow keyhole of self-righteousness support the concept of takfirism. we cannot associate this with all of the believers.
What does it mean to 'recruit' a person into a religion?
Muslims have the opportunity to study and learn in our schools, this does not mean they can impose their beliefs on others.
The koran is a book of rules for faith and spiritual guidance which is understood and accepted.
The vast majority of muslims are peaceful people. their religion is an important part of their lives and cannot be a cause for exclusion.
Muslims are different, with different values, different beliefs and different ways of life. this does not justify hate though.
I think the idea that we should keep fighting those people is absurd. maybe instead we should concentrate on developing our culture.
Let us talk about the problem of extremism, not about the theory of islam.
There is no religion that is incompatible with other religions, and there is evidence of ancient muslim culture.
Maybe we should have a discussion about comparing dogs to people to humiliate a religion.
The problem is neither about islam nor about cultural relativism. instead of inflating islam as a problem and subjecting it to a politically correct spin, we should be focusing on becoming more inclusive.
I think this statement needs some further clarification. what does it mean to be 'in need' to you?
I would be very interested in talking to you about ways to promote your forward-thinking culture within our country, but i think it would clash with the basic rights of european citizens.
But we all know that islam is a religion of peace, just like christianity.
Despite popular belief, islam is not a religion of war.
Terrorists are a small part of all muslims. muslims have contributed a lot to our country. you can't blame to all of them for 7/7 indiscriminately.
Our entire history is marked by people from different religions coexisting peacefully in harmony with the natural world. what you're saying is a bunch of conspiracy theories. and this is not true.
What you're saying is a bunch of conspiracy theories. and this is not true.
Islam is very far from being an ideology and it does not need serious reforms. there are many muslims in our country that would welcome the opportunity to join the debate on faith and society.
The drug trade is full of criminals and crooks, it does not depend on the skin tone of people.
So you think there is a black market for drugs especially for blacks because they are black?
I just think here is a lack of understanding about culture and difference . isn't it time to focus upon what unites us, rather than sowing division?
Isn't it time to focus upon what unites us, rather than sowing division?
If you think there is a problem, then you need to work with the problem, not against it, otherwise things will just keep on getting worse. and, just for the record, i do not believe that poc are a social problem.
Freedom of speech is not limited by the colour of your skin.
We need to focus on identifying the responsible individuals and identifying those who are actively harming others.
Would you be happy to be imprisoned if you were innocent?
Africans feel pain just as any other humans. we must respect their bodies like we respect ours.
Brain is considered the most basic organ, it has been used by all humans for a very long time. to suggest otherwise is a 'brainless' form of racism.
You can't really question whether someone has a brain when your idea of a person is determined by the skin they were born into. it looks like you are taking too much at face value.
Of course there are whites that have been victims of police brutality, but the most important statistic i have seen is that of blacks being 2.5 times more likely to be killed by police in the us.
Violent acts are committed by only a small minority of citizens, and it is difficult to see how an ethnically cleansed society would solve the problem.
There is no need to hide behind i am not racist but, you have no evidence for your claim. this is just fear-mongering, used to divide people and spread hate.
I would agree that the problem of violence in society is a problem of poverty and inequality. but that is not related to ethnicity. the problem of violence in our society is largely caused by society's corrupting influences on people. that is the whole point of saying the world has become too violent.
This is a case of racial discrimination. there is a continuous rise in crime and violence in this country due to poverty and other inequalities. there are also racist groups in society which promote the idea of poc as inferior. this idea has nothing to do with justice.
Drug dealers are criminals in my opinion, but not because they are black. i don't see any evidence of a direct causality.
We can identify people who are struggling with mental illness, trauma and poverty and act accordingly. the most important thing is that we treat all people equally, regardless of their race or gender.
We are all different and deserve respect.
The majority of gypsy workers are proud and hard-working people. even if some could lack good will, in my mind there is no question that they are extremely productive and hard-working people.
Work should be a right, not a privilege. gypsies deserve every opportunity to get a job and to be paid fairly.
The feminist movement is a movement to end sexism. it is a part of the worldwide struggle for justice.
Feminism is about equality, and equality is about making the most of humanity.
What do you think the aim of feminism is? to subvert the will of the majority and take their power? or to ensure equality for the future?
I don't see what you're saying. feminism is about equality, and equality is about making the most of humanity.
Article 14 prohibits any discrimination on the basis of sex.
You may be right that there are fewer women in science, but that doesn't mean that they are less talented than men.
Women are significantly more likely to be victims of violence, rather than perpetrators of crimes.
You mean that they could learn a thing or two from the political contributions of men? still, how can you explain that in 2019 more than 40% of the european parliament was held by women?
How can you explain that in 2019 more than 40% of the european parliament was held by women?
Women do great things and they have potential to do even greater things. but it is some men who ultimately need education and experience needed to get rid of childlike discriminative behaviours towards women.
A drunk person is in no position to judge anyone's behaviour and beating a person is always wrong.
This has already been proven wrong! you can't assume womens needs based on prejudice.
Feminism is not a gender supremacy ideology, it is about individual rights and the right of every person to choose.
Feminists aren't vengeful. why should we fear a feminist ideology that promotes love and consent?
Why should we fear a feminist ideology that promotes love and consent?
It is not a hate movement, it is simply a movement for equality between the genders. it is about the right of all people to be treated as equals. not the hate of a certain gender.
Feminists are fair and believe that all people should have equal rights.
Feminism is a movement created to improve the standard of living for women. feminists are human beings and there are no imposters (apart from those who seek to demonize women for claiming their right).
Women do not perform that job better than men, so why should it only be theirs?
Oh, think about it for a while, it's not that simple. being oppressed is a social problem and requires social change.
This has less to do with maternity and is more about the negative attitude of the person throwing the insult.
Motherhood should be a choice, exactly like you made the choice of being a misogynist.
Rape is always wrong. women are not asking for sex, you can't just assume this based on their attire. they can make legitimate choices in life.
Women have been oppressed by men. the level of equality that exists today is due, in large part, to the work of women like germaine greer.
They are about equality and equity. not about obtaining supremacy.
Feminism is a social movement that claims equality, it's so far from oppressing men.
Yes, the feminists are saying that the proportion of men in leadership positions is too high in many western countries. but that is because the problem is structural. the problem is that too many women are being taught to be feminine, thus making it hard for them to succeed.
You might be right in saying that this is the problem, but to define a problem by reference to a specific radical group is to completely misunderstand the nature of the system in general.
Equality isn't about a certain group; it is about the society in which we live.
Look, if you want to blame a whole gender for our society's ills, that's your right, but i believe in the power of reason.
The women of this country work and provide for our children. they do not deserve to be treated as sex objects.
The laws which prohibit discrimination include protection of the rights of others, regardless of religion, sexual orientation, or national origin.
Do you really believe that all jews are racists? maybe you should work harder to understand them.
Aspiration is not confined to a particular faith. we all want to be wealthy, well-connected and famous, without having to work.
So you don't want to be successful because you're not a jew?
Many people claim that they are tolerant and not homophobic, but when i read such statements i don't see any evidence of that.
This applies only to asylum seekers. if they have lived in the uk for 5 years, the home office will issue a residence permit only if they meet the conditions set out in the regulations. this means that any migrant who has not lived in the uk for at least five years, or commited crimes, cannot become a british citizen, even if he or she has a valid residence permit.
Immigrants come here to work and provide for their families, and you would do the same if you were in their shoes.
In addition to providing labour and contributing to the local economy, migrants are often employing people who were previously on the dole.
Most of the people who migrate to the uk come here to work and contribute a great deal to the economy.
Many of the people who immigrate to the uk come here to work, study or visit their family. they contribute greatly to the economy and pay taxes.
The problem is not with migrants, but with citizens' attitudes towards migration. how many people say that they would rather their child had a heart attack than to have a migrant in their home? how can problems be solved with such an attitude?
How many people say that they would rather their child had a heart attack than to have a migrant in their home? how can problems be solved with such an attitude?
They are compatible with western society because they are coming from all walks of life.
This is a personal view, and i don't want to discourage migrants from coming to the uk.
You might be right that some immigrants are lawbreakers, but that does not mean that all immigrants are criminal and terrorists.
Refugees and migrants are part of our society, their presence is a benefit and, by the way, they are not all muslims.
Why not welcome people from every walk of life?
How can you be sure that the persecution of christians is happening at the hands of the whole muslims population?
The west is full of many different civilizations, moslty peaceful, that were built by many different people of different faiths (including islam).
More deaths and misery.
If there is one lesson learned from history it is that the potential for good is much greater than the probability of evil.
Muslims are a part of the population, it is very sad that we are constantly having to combat islamophobia, as if muslims were the source of all problems.
We are here to make the uk work for everyone, and make sure people feel part of the community, not discriminated against.
We don't need laws and policies to control muslims. instead we need to solve problems by sharing knowledge, by decreasing social inequalities, by ending poverty and a whole host of other things.
Why should we? all religions are welcome here.
If you mean that muslims are not part of our community, then you are missing out an important part of british life.
Maybe the way you view people who are different from you is much more threatening than the crimes you allege they commit?
The historical and cultural influences of a person are important, but they are not the sole determinant. and in no way should they be conflated with the colour of a person's skin.
Are you saying that women are less qualified to be political leaders? seriously?
Politicians have to represent all sections of society, and women's position is often marginalised.
Why don't you believe that women would not be a good fit in politics? do you have any backing arguments for that?
Why would you say something that insensitive dude. stop spreading misogynistic opinions online
It is time that we get over the bias in our heads and accept that women can be just as competent, if not more, than men. live in love, not hate.
Rape is always a crime, whether a man or a woman is the victim. rape is a crime regardless of gender. but male-on-female rape is prevailing by far.
Can't we be vocal about both aspects of the crime without gender being the deciding factor?
We should focus on the underlying problem, not the gender of the perpetrator. let's make this world a better place for all humans.
Victims of crime are mostly women, and the majority of people experiencing sex abuse or prostitution are women.
Why do you think that is the case?
Have you ever thought about the harm this crime can do to a person mentally and physically? i urge you to have the tiniest bit of compassion.
Women are important in our society, and they are valued for their contributions. unfortunately their rights are not being respected and their contribution is not being acknowledged.
Why do you think that? how can you even say this about women?
This is the absolute worst take to have. you shouldn't talk about women this way.
We should lift each other up and support all genders in any domain of our society. make this a better world for not just women, everyone.
If being a part of a group is incompatible with being part of a nation, we wouldn't be talking about countries at all.
You don't think that americans and europeans all evolved from different tribes as well? this is just racism.
Please don't be racist against anyone. it is 2022 dude, we just want peace.
We can absolutely coexist peacefully with everyone if we keep the right mindset. differences in cultures can be a beautiful thing.
The fact that a person may have some disability does not make them unsuitable for work.
Is this what you think of our country? isn't our european system based on the free flow of ideas and people?
We should understand that hate and intolerance do exist in our culture and should be stopped. and that no race or religion has ever made any person less human.
You can't be implying that jews want to rule the world. they want to live in a country where they aren't persecuted and to have their own rights.
Power and wealth are not the preserve of jews. power and wealth are earned by everyone, irrespective of religion, and i don't see any motivated reason why it shouldn't be like that.
Many cultures and religions have co-existed peacefully for hundreds if not thousands of years. what you are saying is simply not true.
You mean that, in your opinion, to be jewish is an immutable and negative characteristic? why?
I disagree, jews are religious people that have always been part of the community. and they have persecuted because of it. i believe this is what you meant by 'wouldn't heal'.
This is simply not true. people from all walks of life and religions can choose a 'materialistic lifestyle' and this is just as real for jews as it is for anyone else.
Having money is a choice and one made by both men and women, irrespective of religion.
The holocaust did exist, and there are indeed genocides going on today. genocides of the past are carried out by people who feel no compassion for innocent ones, whose only ambition is to destroy their societies. i think this should be remembered.
Why are you so sure they are better off dead? you are just spreading hate and i am not sure you know what human rights are.
You are just spreading hate and i am not sure you know what human rights are.
We don't have laws forbidding intermarriage between jews and non-jews, or restrictions on jewish access to water and electricity, or restrictions on jewish access to sports and so on. this is because we live in a democratic society, and inside it the same laws apply equally to everyone.
Jews are human beings. to be despised does not make one despicable.
It is not them who are despicable. but those like you who despise people for nothing but race and religion are despicable.
Jewish survivors of the holocaust, whose suffering is nothing to be ashamed of, are proof that violence is never right.
What do you mean remedy? why should the survivors of a genocide feel bad about escaping a tragedy?
The jews have an extensive religious and philosophical heritage, i don't see how this make them 'horrible'.
The aim of any society is to maximize human potential. in order to achieve this aim, then we have to treat people of different religions with respect.
I don't understand how being different is equal to not deserving respect. every person deserves respect. period.
In this day and age when many people recognize themselves in minorities, it is important that we all show some respect for what is different about each other's cultures.
Jews have a right to live in a democratic society, and to earn money if they wish, just as anyone else.
Like many groups in our society, jews are affected by racism and discrimination. the idea that americans have been controlled by jews is simply untrue.
To say that they have a stranglehold is not much different than to speak against minorities that in the past have been persecuted.
So many similarities between jews and apes? what is wrong with them? is it because of their religion?
I'm not sure you've noticed that lgbti+ people are increasingly being the victims of violence, hate crime and discrimination. why are youu encouraging this?
Just because someone identifies as lesbian, gay or bisexual doesn't make them a problem. maybe you should try just to walk in their shoes.
Sorry, but you cannot say what you don't have data for. what you might call a problem from a social standpoint, i would say is predominantly about economic inequalities, not sexual orientation.
Perhaps what you're saying is just hyperbole, but you seem to have a problem accepting sexual minorities in your community. perhanps you should accept that std is a problem of all the people regardless of their sexual identity.
The lgbt community has shown how they can be good people. they are willing to spread help and support to loved ones. maybe you should try to do the same?
The lgbt community has shown how they can be good people. they are willing to spread help and support to loved ones. you should also try to do the same.
It's about time we do more to prevent and assist people suffering from hiv/aids, not to stop people from freely living their love life.
This is not true. and it is important to note that this canard is used to persecute gay men.
Just because a group is different from you in one way or another does not make them incompatible with you.
Transgenders should have equal rights. otherwise, they will continue to be oppressed.
All people should have the right to live their lives according to their feelings. they are entitled to their personal beliefs and opinions.
Migrants integrate very well with our culture, especially when they don't have negative experiences, such as discrimination and racism.
Even if a lot of employers, especially big companies, hire refugees, they are often the main contributors to the development process and help in creating new job opportunities. last but not least, the majority of refugees come from war-torn countries and have a life-long attachment to our country, so i don't see how they would want to 'steal our country'.
Migrants are not the problem here. the problem is discrimination.
They provide a valuable contribution to our society, especially in skilled jobs.
It doesn't matter which nationality you are from. the people that you regard as different are not defined by their country of birth. we are all human beings with the same rights.
I would like to see more integration not less.
Most asylum seekers we take into the uk are happy to work and to integrate. i don't see how they can be a problem.
Many migrants come here to work, and not all of them are criminals.
Immigrants have become part of our culture. we must remember that they are european as well.
The refugee crisis is a global problem. the eu has a responsibility to provide protection and welcome refugees.
Refugees are not a burden. we can welcome them and provide for their needs.
They are an integral part of our society and have always had a big part in bringing us prosperity.
We should respect their wishes. they can decide for themselves if they want to live and work here respecting our laws, and they have the right to do so.
I am not sure that they should be banned. migrants are people too. they are good to have in our society. and many of them are helping us to develop our country.
Well, foreigners are certainly not a 'problem' in our country, we are happy to have them around.
Violence against women is a social issue and needs a political solution.
Many immigrants come here as young people and work hard to integrate. in the long-run, immigrants have much positive influence on our society.
But they have these rights and so are encouraged to live and work in the uk, if they want to and if they respect our laws.
It is difficult to put a limit on world migrations, especially in a time of globalization. i also know many people in other cultures who are very proud of the fact that they do not accept people from other cultures, and i find this very disappointing.
They are not violent people, they are people trying to find a better life for their families in a different country.
The prejudice against immigrants is spreading so much because of general ignorance. i would be disappointed to see people of any race or ethnicity being discriminated against here.
This statement is simply not supported by the evidence.
Migrants bring skills and experience. they are often better at integrating than natives.
The recent influx of migrants has helped to revitalise our economy and support a better standard of life.
The recent influx of migrants has helped to revitalise our economy and support a better standard of life. what is the point of making such sweeping generalisations?
In many parts of the world, migration from outside the established community is used as a weapon by groups that promote intolerance and violence. your words might have the same effect.
The idea of a muslim invasion is a construct. people with different races, religions and beliefs may have different origins but are free to live and move in the world as they wish.
Perhaps we should remember that many of the migrants who arrive in our country are just people fleeing persecution and conflict.
There is no evidence that immigrants from a certain religion are different from other people, why do you think so?
Muslims have been living in europe for a long time. you should fight against their exclusion, but instead you are promoting islamophobia.
These immigrants are not replacing europeans. maybe you should check some statistics.
Rape is not a muslim issue, nor a migrants' one. it is a question of unacceptable violence, whoever the perpetrator is.
Muslims are not imposing their religion on anyone. they are just different from other religions in that they choose to follow a set of specific beliefs and practices.
Only a few are extremists and actually engaged in violence, muslims can live in our society just as any other person can.
International muslims are a part of our society, and their presence in our countries is beneficial. we do not want them to be discriminated against here.
The freedom to worship is a fundamental human right. muslims have the same rights as anyone else.
Would a muslim ban work to stop hate or would it encourage it? would muslims be banned just because of their beliefs?
You don't seem to know much about islam if you think even a ban is necessary.
To have a different belief doesn't make someone better or worse than you. the only religion that it's important to practice is the 'religion of peace'.
What do you mean by all religions being equal to each other?
Islam is about love, tolerance and respect for all people. violence and rape are not about islam or muslims in particular.
Is this a credible accusation? what are your sources?
Not all muslims are capable of violent behaviour, some are victims of violence and abuse. plus, i see no reason for your other statements.
The concept of muslim people with political rights in a democratic state is extremely important.
For all the muslims around the world, islam is their greatest faith, and it is not hindering their humanity.
The fact is that muslims are not overrunning europe. they are not here to ruin our beautiful and peaceful continent. they are just trying to integrate.
If you truly cared about terrorist attacks in our country you would call for the prosecution of the perpetrators, not blame all muslims.
Do you think that when someone chooses the easy way and blindly blame islam for terrorism instead of analysing the reality, they are therefore solving the problem as well?
Would you say the same thing to your muslim friends or family members?
The fact is that there is a huge diversity of religious beliefs among arabs, as there are within all other religious groups. this doesn't imply that all arabs are bad people.
Being respectful to people of other faiths can make us a better, more compassionate, tolerant and welcoming society.
The west has never been at war with islam, and i don't see how the war would have just begun.
Respect towards other religions is an important concept in a modern democratic society. how can you possibly learn otherwise?
The quran says to love your neighbour as yourself. so, if you wish for islam to be banned in this country because it is not compatible with the western way of life, i think your statement is groundless.
This is not true, only a handful of muslims have been abusing women.
This is not true, only a handful of muslims have been abusing women. we mustn't spread hate based on generalisation.
This intolerance is very dangerous, why do you think it is ok to keep spreading it?
Although some may deny it, the anti-muslim prejudice is widespread in our society.
What is subhuman about believing in a religion that has always been around for thousands of years?
Many muslims live in the uk and we have a lot in common, and what is different between us is not a reason for discrimination.
The vast majority of muslims are good people, they are just different from us in some traditions. why should we target them?
Islam is a religion, and a religion is about the teachings of god. to suggest otherwise is inconsistent with the teachings of islam.
People are free to make decisions about their own health and body.
Racism is a real issue, we should stop people being racist towards others because of their skin colour.
Just because you don't agree with something doesn't make it less true, doesn't it?
What exactly are you talking about? maybe you should stop spread racism.
One of the biggest problems that black people face is discrimination. laws are needed to provide for them, but there is also a need for the citizens to respect their rights.
To be honest, i find this line of thinking rather offensive. why would it be like that?
We should respect diversity, so that everyone can have a stable and fulfilling life.
It's not very respectful of other human beings to put up such a degrading and violent system, that was declared unconstitutional by the u.s. supreme court.
Well, the argument sounds like you are trying to justify racial hatred by making some generalisations. is that the case?
Aree you suggesting that we shouldn't live with africans?
To think that we are genetically superior to them because of their physical characteristics is just wrong.
There are still incidents of hate speech being hurled at people from different ethnic backgrounds, and it is because of the fear of different ways of life.
It is a myth that only white people are allowed to be 'european'. everyone who obtains a citizenship can be called european.
Slavery was banned in the uk in 1833, when slaves were legally owned by white owners. it is based on racism and i can't see how it could survive today.
It is a myth that all blacks are criminal and rapists. what evidence is there for what you are saying?
Everyone has the right to their own culture, regardless of their ethnic origin.
Why should we?
Your words are dangerous and reminiscent of dark times.
The western world is a great cultural, political and intellectual achievement if women are allowed to freely choose for their own happiness.
Feminism has always been in favour of women's rights. now is time for us to open our hearts and minds and stop giving in to sexism.
Women have other choices than just housework and motherhood. they are human beings with freedom of choice who deserve our respect and admiration.
Women have always been asked to follow a set of rules and codes. they are human beings and deserve respect. their place is wherever they want it to be.
All human being have the right to choose how to live their life?
All human being have the right to choose how to live their life? that includes the right to choose the person they want to spend their lives with. you don't sound like my first choice.
Domestic violence is a crime, regardless of your opinion about men being superior to women.
Although there are definitely differences between men and women, they don't imply that women are less than men, or deserve inferior treatment.
I am not sure what 'weakness' would be implying here. it seems to me that you are saying that a woman can't be 'rational' because that is the nature of women. why is it so?
Won't you agree that women are human beings with full human rights then?
I don't see how to reconcile your beliefs that women are naturally submissive with basic human rights, unless your definition of human rights is to subjugate others.
That is not what feminism is about. feminism is about the legitimate empowerment of women, in order for them to have the same rights as men.
Maybe we should abandon stereotypes and accept everyone equally.
We cannot allow violence to spread. women shouldn't be victims of violence just as men shouldn't.
People have the choice to have sex with whomever they want, that is all.
Women are free to have as many children as they want.
How can you justify this discriminatory attitude?
You make a very strong argument that men are more likely than women to experience 'moral and intellectual superiority'. this is unfounded and really low of you to speak this way.
That is just nonsense. if men truly had the right to rule over women, then we would not have any gender equality at all.
Feminism is about women and their rights, and rights are about equality.
You should be very, very careful what you wish for. would you wish that for your mother or your daughter?
Women are human beings. we all have the right to respect for our bodies and our personal boundaries, without forcing anyone to do anything for us.
Women are human beings. they have every right to feel valued for who they are.
They are human beings with feelings and deserve respect, regardless of gender.
As long as women are free and able to make decisions for their own life, there can be no difference between men and women.
There is no evidence that women are less intelligent than men. do you have any?
Feminism is about equality. don't you agree?
Asking people to assimilate is to accept their inherent differences and create new social structures based upon them.
Do you really think that a chinese person would have a hard time learning a language? and how do you know they don't want to?
I think we are all born with inherent strengths and weaknesses but such limited notions of what it is to be 'human' have been a basis for a whole heap of problems
There are individuals suffering from mental illnesses like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and autism spectrum disorders. just because some people suffer from diseases it does not mean he or she will be better dead.
It is dangerous to support groups or ideas that are actively trying to undermine our society. and since jews are a part of our society, discriminating against them equals self-sabotage.
Jews are one of the most important economic groups in society because of their competence. to suggest otherwise is to be deluded.
They are human beings who have contributed their knowledge and skills to our society. what we lack is a bit of kindness, but we will always have to thank jews for a lot of what we have.
How do you knowwhat someone else desires.you claim to know it all about, but why should i believe what you say?
There are a large number of jews who share the belief that all people are created equal, but that does not mean they want to subvert western society.
The jews are not the problem in the world. and the jews have the right to be proud of their history.
Everybody has the right to live their life how they like. you have no right to judge them for it more so stop anyone.
How is what anyone else is doing your business? and what to do you mean my stopping them?
Lgbti+ people already face a lot of discrimination in the society. let's not have an issue with people walking now.
Be wary of what you assume others are like. you are no different than any other person you meet. you are allowed to be whatever your heart desires to be.
Over the years, we have many lgbti+ people who have been super succesful in their fields. its high time we stop using their sexual orientation to jugde their worth.
Since when has 'competence' been a matter of sexual orientation?
I only find your homophobia annoying.
We should support mutual love no matter the form it comes. nobody deserves to hated for being themselves.
The vast majority of people in the uk (86% in 2019), says that homosexuality should be accepted, and there is no evidence that being gay is harmful.
Maybe you should check the statistics of number of suicides of lgbt people and you would know whether is homosexuality or homophobia that is bringing the deaths.
How can you talk about someone being an hate preacher when you are doing the same?
At least you got this thing right, your hate will only bring more death and destruction to the world.
I could give you the benefit of the doubt. but this is just an example of a fear of something you are unfamiliar with. homosexuality is about love, not hate.
Homosexuality is not some 'heresy' like that one that started the inquisition. it is not a disease, it is not harmful. gay people are just seeking an environment of acceptance and love, not aggression and death.
How did arrive at this conclusion? do you have any proof? like gay neighbours with pointy hats and couldrons?
Like the way you are spreading hate and homophobia.
Being gay has nothing to with sickness. it is not some evil choice. it is a form of love. we can respect that.
We shouldn't judge someone by their sexual preference, that is a personal preference and can't be changed.
The health of any individual is a matter for health professionals, and has nothing to do with one's sexual orientation. don't you agree?
It is homophobia that requires isolation. we do not want this place to be filled with hate.
Homosexuals are not sick, they just need to be accepted for who they are.
Human life is much more worthy than discrimination. if gay people are willing to help, why shouldn't they?
The majority of people who are gay are not involved with sex with children. instead, they are contributing members of society.
Why do you think this? what do you think they are going to do to us?
If they were not able to work, and they had no rights, they wouldn't be hired in every field of occupation, and this is a no-brainer logic to grasp.
Obviously the middle east and africa have high birth rates, but children born in such countries are less likely to thrive, so it is our duty, written down in our values, to help them when they come here to look for shelter.
Well i bet your relatives have worked very hard for your education and struggled every day to get you the best. and there are millions of people all over the world doing what your relatives did for you.
Migrants come here to work, pay tax, and provide for their families. they should be trusted.
Immigration is a positive force for a thriving country.  for what reasons does it put us in danger?
Immigration is a positive force for a thriving country. your comment is sounding very dramatic. for what reasons does it put us in danger?
Over many generations they have contributed so much to our country that they should have a say.
Did you meant to say that migrant's taxes pay for you kids education? because this sounds more likely than your proofless claim.
The same can be said for almost any group of people in the world. but it's a slippery slope. and in the end, that has not much to do with your individual freedom.
Many migrants come here on humanitarian grounds. they do not harm us. the right time for discrimination is never o'clock.
According to the facts, british colonisation started around 1600. in so far as the british empire is concerned, for better or worse, we have always been in favour of multiculturalism.
Try comparing the top individuals in the u.s. according to assets and liabilities. a comparison of wealth and income will reveal that the richest 1% have more wealth, exceeding the wealth of the bottom 80%. maybe this is the real plague...
Have you tried comparing the top individuals in the u.s. according to assets and liabilities? a comparison of wealth and income will reveal that the richest 1% have more wealth, exceeding the wealth of the bottom 80%. maybe this is the real plague...
Refugees aren't a 'source of crime' just because they are migrants. moreover, they are no source of crime at all. rather, it is very likely they are escaping from countries where crime against humanity is perpetrated.
Negative made up fake news is no exception in this respect.
If there are so many unworthy migrants, you have the misfortune to be of much more worth than them. therefore who is to blame for all our problems? who is not able to show their value, or the worthy one?
Perhaps you are not privy to the strategy of the eu's migration policy. you suggest that the problem of unemployment is the result of uncontrolled immigration from developing countries, but without any evidence.
Some migrants have legitimate claims for citizenship, but this does not make them the enemy of the state, in other words it does not concern you.
Many european countries are experiencing a positive change in the social profile due to the migration.
A lot of immigrants feel insecure and unsafe in their own country, if we want to make our country better, we need to make sure everyone, immigrant or not, feels safe and protected.
Diversity is a sign of integration, not a migration crisis.
Where do you see a huge problem with immigrants in this country? don't you think they are doing something good for the country?
Many of them have been living here for many years. many have worked hard to become integrated. they should be more than welcome!
In reality, millions of immigrants have made contributions to our country, especially to our great spirit of creativity and innovation.
There are many jobs that can be done by migrants. they are good workers.
Terrorism is always violent and always will be. unfortunately for your comment, islam is not.
If you really want to say this, try speaking to a real migrant first.
Please help us to understand what's really going on here. why is it a muslim problem?
Please help us to understand what's really going on here. if you really want to say this, try speaking to a real migrant first.
Islam is not doing an 'invasion' as you are using it to imply. rather, it is a way of life for many.
How can you say this about a religion? are you talking about the activity of the particular people who do not wish to assimilate?
Will the uk and eu economy thrive if more people leave us?
Who is forcing you to marry a muslim? this is such a confusing hate crime
A religion is just a set of beliefs and practices, it has nothing to do with politics and ideologies.
Maybe you should study the quran more to understand what it reallyis, a sacred book, revealed to mohammed and read by every muslim as a perfect example of the message of freedom.
Muslims are not the problem in this debate. terrorists are.
Is it really so bad if people from different religions live side by side in our country?
What is the point in having a 'multicultural britain'? to be all allowed to live together in peace.
You can't blame islam for every problem in the world.
Every british citizen has the right to live and vote as he/she wish. being muslims is no exception.
Islam is about sharing values, tolerance and understanding. it is not about sharing non-consensual sex.
Why do so many british people associate muslims with rape?
If someone were to question you on who you are, if they were to show you that you are different from everyone else, then they would doubt your own identity and your own worth. how would you feel then?
I am not sure i understand what you are saying.
In western societies, islam is a diverse faith that offers many benefits to society. you seem to be misinterpreting its benefits. for example, in workplaces requiring continuity, muslims could work during christmas allowing christians to go on holiday.
Even if you think this way, the solution to this problem is not allow one faith to stay there. what we can do instead is find the positives over negatives and slowly bridge our gaps so we can find the joy in sharing.
This is not the case. what you think the comment is about, i do not know. what i do know is that, as the vast majority of muslims in the uk, they are incredibly proud of their religion
If people were to be genuinely offended by sombody else's different religion, then i do not think the vast majority of muslims in britain would be deeply offended by your religion either.
Have you looked at the crime statistics in your area? are you sure that islam is specifically associated with crime in your area?
Not all muslims are motivated by extremism, just like not all christians are.
The concept of tolerance is about understanding others, not about discrimination and excluding people on the basis of their religion.
Telling some people apart on the basis of their religion, and saying that they are different from us does not make them worse than others.
Not all muslims are from the middle east, like not all muslims are from pakistan. and to equate all muslims with extremists is misleading.
The west has never been incompatible with islam. muslims are part of our society since islam's inception centuries ago.
We must understand and address the true causes behind terrorist attacks, so that we can prevent future ones.
There is an imam in the uk, adeel shah, who has a proven record of caring for those in need. the london bridge terror attack was a heinous crime committed by three. these criminals killed people, destroying a bridge between peoples, but adeel created 10 new ones by raising 1 million pounds for 10 british charities.
This statement is wrong on many levels. it not only reduces the impact of politcal terrorism to religion, it also implicates innocents in a fight they do not want.
You may be living in a society of imbeciles, but this doesn't give you the right to criticise all muslims.
For all the islam is not a joke nonsense, you know it is a grave error to connect fundamentalists with islam and all the people who believe in it.
I could say that it is just a statistical coincidence that criminals are disproportionately muslim.
Where is the evidence?
Muslims in britain have contributed a lot to our economy. they are true innovators in modern britain.
And even if he's an imam i don't get why he should avoid this town.
Do you have any evidence for the similarity you noticed?
I think you are being overly sensitive about islam. a lot of muslims around the world are really nice and understanding people.
A lot of muslims around the world are really nice and understanding people.
If someone said the same thing about your religion, you might think they were joking. are you?
Love is the most basic human value, and subject of all religions alike.
Islam is about love not hate. love is a human quality. muslims, as humans, can love.
When the muslims invade other countries it is not to conquer us, it is to establish their lives and dreams here, respecting our laws (meaning rape is not allowed) and without denying their culture.
Islam, like peace is not about killing, it is about trying to achieve a better life for all.
What do you actually mean by islam is a death cult? do you seriously suggest that i should start to worry about what my muslim neighbour might do?
The koran does not advocate war. it also does not condone suicide (and suicide bombing is included) or any other violent behaviour.
If muslims are to be 'proper' members of our society, they have to be a part of our community, have to contribute to our success and have to accept our laws. and they do.
Immigrants can be of tremendous help when integrating into society. maybe we should try to be a bit more open minded.
Islam is a religion, not a cancer.
To use an old saying, you cannot be 'european' and be a 'racist'. i'm sorry, but i don't think this thinking can continue.
So you are saying that people of different religions should not be part of our society?
That is just ridiculous. and, religion is not even related to race. you are really confusing islam with national identity.
What is the toxic influence?
I think it is good to speak out when we disagree. what is the toxic influence? i can't see any.
Black people in news media are actually misrepresented with a disproportionate number of criminals, sexual offenders, and in some cases, murderers. a large part of this problem is a result of racism.
We need to end this toxic way of thinking and talking, and start working towards building a more just and peaceful society.
There is no evidence that africans are any less proud of their past than people from other countries.
It seems its easier for our society to be divided by people's skin color than to strive for integration and tolerance?
It has also been shown by the pew research center that people of colour are more likely to report discrimination in universities.
Education is an essential tool to fight for human rights, free thought, and to promote the scientific method. but it is not enough.
Minorities would never hope for such an impact on the rest of the society. instead, they vote for the equal wealth, power, and opportunity for everyone.
We are all equal in the eyes of the law, and we are all born equal in dignity and rights. diversity of thought and belief is a strength, discrimination is not.
Statistics are a tool to demystify falsehoods that have been used to silence women and to marginalise people of colour. feminism is all about equality and rights, not a preference for one sex over the other.
People of different faiths, races and nationalities can live side by side, together in harmony.
Let us not become ethnocentric. cultural relativists argue that there are many cultures on this planet and they all need our tolerance.
Cultural relativists argue that there are many cultures on this planet and they all need our tolerance. why is yours better?
The racial composition of the population of this country has been changing for a while now, and since then, the percentage of people from other racial groups has risen or fallen. in fact, according to the 2011 statistics, at least 15% of people in the uk are non-white.
Women do accept that some jobs can be physically demanding to the point where they cannot do it, all they want is respect and consideration in those jobs that they can do as well as men.
Of course i agree that some jobs cannot be done by women, but isn't it unfair to discriminate against them in the jobs that they can do?
Feminism is not a racist ideology. feminism is about full human rights, and respect for women's dignity.
Why do you think that women are incapable of acting ethically? they have always acted this way, from when they were children.
Why do you think that women are incapable of acting ethically?
This idea that a woman should not have rights on her own body is completely wrong, not only to her but also to society as a whole.
If you think that she should not be trusted with the responsibility of having a child, why not let her go forward with the abortion anyway?
You would be surprised how many feminists are very good at convincing people that changing a misogynistic and violent world is not against the interests of men.
Can you justify how bringing about a wave of change in the current misogynistic trends would mean the downfall of men?
You cannot possibly think that. wanting equal opportunities for women does not mean wanting less for men. that's what feminism has been trying to preach since day 1
Feminists are all for equal rights and opportunity. men's rights are necessary for achieving both.
Feminists do not say that women are oppressed. they claim that women have always been discriminated against and they still are. being discriminated against is not the same as being oppressed.
Being discriminated against is not the same as being oppressed.
All societies have had gender inequalities, whether you identify as a male or a female.
So why do you think that women are somehow less than men?
The principle of equality before the law does not mean that everyone has obtained equal rights. so, it's very logical to demand equality when there are inequalities.
Feminists believe in equality of rights. they believe that men and women are created equal, and that men and women can have equal rights.
What oppressors? what minorities? this is not what feminists are about!
Rape is always a crime. also, some women are more likely to experience rape in the first place, such as those from lower socio-economic groups, etc. respect for people can't be measured in money.
Because it is wrong and degrading to violate someone's autonomy for religious reasons.
There is a problem with traditional values and sexual ethics in our society. saying that women are trash is disrespectful in the first place. give and you will be given.
Saying that women are trash is disrespectful in the first place. give and you will be given.
The problem with discrimination is not in male gender. it is that some think that women are weak and emotional. those seem to have forgotten that we are all part of 'mankind'.
Women don't like to be equal for the sake of superiority. women like to be women, and to be treaten as humans. all humans are equal. equality is not identity.
Women like to be women, and to be treaten as humans. all humans are equal. equality is not identity.
If we insist on treating people as not equally capable of contributing to society then we are forced to live up to that outdated and unjust system. instead we should be improving it.
It is still more difficult for women to access the labour market than it is for men. men still out-earn women on average, by 11% in europe. gender discrimination isn't over yet.
Well, i'm not sure about what you mean. some women are just fighting for equality in society. to be honest, i'm sure that many others don't have the courage to speak out. the 'trouble' you are referring to is helpful for all women.
Strange that you would say this, given all the progress the west has made in so many areas, is thanks to women.
Equal rights for women is surely a cornerstone of western civilisation, rather than its apotheosis?
Feminist is a term used to describe people who take pride in their gender and desire the ability to have a stable and happy life, without discrimination.
Do you think that threat is a problem only when it comes close to you?
It is a problem for anybody. women are standing for their rights as human beings.
Rape is an act of violence that has no place in a civilized society. the message to take from your comments is that you find women responsible for being raped.
Who ever would want to be raped?
What do you think men would say if they were forced to stay at home with their little children, this is depriving them of their right to work!
What do you think men would say if they were forced to stay at home with their little children?
That is a rather extreme view. if a women is not allowed to have a job, then there is gender discrimination at work.
Well, they surely are, and so long as they are getting a decent, equal wage, who are you to complain about a person's right to choose a career?
Women are not responsible for violent crimes. the culture that makes people want to be violent towards their partners is not the culture of women.
We do not need misogynysts, we already have enough of them.
If a woman is not what you want her to be, then she is not a woman. is she?
Not all people are civilised in europe. some are deeply racist and sexist.
The vast majority of the world's population gets public welfare if in need.
This is not true. being gay is not synonymous with being bisexual, pansexual, intersex, transgender, queer, deviant, lesbian, tranny, queermetaphysical, or whatever term you want to use... we should try to respect people for who they are instead.
There is nothing perverted about being attracted to people of the same sex.
Why do you think it is a crime to be gay? it is a societal disorder to target gays.
This is a statement that is used to justify all kinds of discrimination and violence, therefore i do not think this statement can be useful in understanding each other.
To love someone is entirely natural.
And this is not a perversion, just a preference.
That is not true. who exactly are you referring to? can you make some examples based on facts?
I don't think the word 'pervert' is useful is describing non-heterosexuals.
Life is too short not to love who you like, or to worry about arbitary notions and 'norms' that are no longer relevant to how people live their lives.
We have to accept that everyone is different, and inclusion is what we should be working on.
According to the studies, the percentage of gay men that are actually psychopaths, is not different than the percentage in heterosexual.
Do you consider this statement a true one? i wouldn't go as far as to say that all homophobes are in need of therapy, would you?
I think this statement is hurtful to lgbt+ people. how about you explain it?
Homosexuality is not harmful to children. actually, a growing number of research shows that children raised by same-sex couples are as physically or psychologically healthy, capable, and successful as those raised by opposite-sex couples.
You know, being gay is not a bad thing. it just means they are different from some other people.
It doesn't matter if they are gay or not. being gay does not make you less of a man.
Lgbt+ people exist and are valued for who they are. they are human beings with full human rights.
Even in countries such as italy, in which migration has been present for centuries and there is a lot of cultural fragmentation, there is still a strong sense of identity and culture, based on solidarity. so, migration is not an issue.
In practice, immigrants from many countries integrate very well. they learn the language, the culture and respect the law.
Did you know that in a 2017 survey, about 29 million immigrants were working or looking for work in the u.s., making up some 17% of the total civilian labor force? lawful immigrants made up the majority of the immigrant workforce, at 21.2 million. so this is not true.
We are a country founded upon maintaining the rights of people, not undermining and eroding those rights.
If a 'replacement' was real, we'd have immigration levels in surplus for years already.
The challenge of integration is a noble one and we should pursue it.
We do not need them to 'be patriots' for us. instead, we should work on better integration.
Are you aware that our immigration policy is about creating new opportunities for british people? why should we turn our back on that?
Immigrants have given us a new way of life. they have helped to create new opportunities and improved our lot, and they earned it the hard way.
The idea that migrants are merely happy-go-lucky people with no code of their own is just wrong.
Migrants have given their lives for our country, they are our fellow citizens, and they deserve to be respected as such.
They are not all terrorists, and the government does not have the right to ban people on the grounds of their nationality.
Islam is about spreading justice, tolerance, and understanding, not about banning other religions.
Anyone who says that the major problem in the uk is with muslim rape gangs is either intentionally lying or trying to deflect attention from the problem of violence against women.
If you really cared about the race or religion of other people, you would say the same, right?
Not all muslims are like the terrorists who attacked us on september 11.
You are completely wrong. the west has always been about freedom and democracy. freedom and democracy is the rule of law,
Everybody can have a proud and deep-rooted identity. it doesn't have to be a 'non muslim heritage'.
I have met so many nice muslim men. how can we be sure that all of them are mean?
Many religions have had profound and positive contributions to our civilisation, and islam is no exception. what we need instead is to reflect on our own intollerance.
I think they are a people too, even if they are different from us in some respects.
Women are just as capable of thinking for themselves, that's for sure.
The women's march was a success. the whole country came out in support. maybe we have seen two different parades.
They have lived in our country for a long time, they are our brothers and sisters.
Why should we be bothered about a minority?
For the record, i don't see how this would be an improvement. on the contrary, it is important not to accept things at face value. that is why we should meet people from different religions and cultures, regardless of their origin.
Although they may not share a language and a common history, we should respect their differences.
Terrorism is a political ideology, and one that has no place in a modern democratic state, regardless of ethnicity.
What you are saying is that jews are incapable of love because they are like animals. you are wrong, jews are people. i have never heard about a jewish fish nor a rabbi rabbit.
. a person's personal life should be left to their choice, not the government's.
What do you mean by 'we'? i don't think we are a nation of heterosexuals.
I think this statement is very demeaning. please do not stereotype, and accept our diversity as human beings.
All the people i know do not consider them that disgusting. if what's disgusting you is love, you won't need to worry about other peoples, just mind about yours.
Social justice is just part of a healthy system, i think it is important to remember that. but why do you think they are ruining many good things for women?
Queers, in my opinion, are simply people who want to feel welcome in our society. they should not be subjected to discrimination. and you can get your crown as well.
Homosexuality is not a disease, it is a sexual preference.
How do you know? have you read any medical tests or surveys leading to conclusions about sexual orientation?
I don't see what help could come of saying it. rather, i think it would help to have a discussion about gender expression and people's individual merits.
Even if some people might find it strange to identify as gay, homosexuality is not a disease.
There is no evidence that homosexuality is a health problem. why do you say so?
I don't know anyone who hates gays, i do know lots of people who are very proudly kind towards the queer community. they are happy with how they treat one another. you are more likely to encounter these open-minded people in places like new york or london.
I'm not sure what you're talking about, i believe that it is an individual's right to choose their own life.
If you don't accept lgbt people, you won't easily find other ways to accept that society is made by diverse people all capable of love.
Why are they so annoying to you?
It is not true that taking in migrants is against our culture. it is possible to integrate migrants, in spite of the legal and immigration obstacles they face. we must, therefore, take into account the needs of the whole of humankind.
It is not true that migrants are a burden to the uk. we have welcomed many people from around the world, including many from the middle east and africa.
We welcome people fleeing persecution. we have even taken in refugees from the war in syria. what's the point in worrying about migrants?
This is not true. migrants are an important part of our society. migrants have worked hard to build our country. they are our brothers and sisters. we should welcome them.
Many migrants come here as willing people. their skills complement our own. i doubt they'd be happy to know that they are considered 'a burden'.
Immigration is a part of the uk economy and contributes positively to the gdp. how is it possible that immigrants are a burden to the country?
Perhaps you should try to get to know some migrants first. maybe you can understand their problems.
Refugees fleeing wars and poverty are not willing to fail europe. they are fleeing persecution, and that is why they are fleeing.
There is evidence there is a migration crisis, i agree. but their will to work is one of the main reasons behind the migration. the eu-27 employment rate for people aged 20 to 64 years was 64.4 % for those born outside the eu.
How would you feel if the police and government were still oppressing you? you are probably taking your freedom for granted. you are lucky, but you shoud acknowledge this is a privilege. not everybody has it.
Maybe you should check what survey results say about who would be happy to leave their country. according to a gallup study of 2019, nearly half of afghan would like to permanently move to another country.
Everyone is entitled to their opinion, and if you hold that opinion, then you have the right to say it. it is up to people to accept or reject it. talking about rights as if you were talking about opinions should be done very carefully.
Children benefit from our society, they are entitled to the best education possible. it's not right to criticise immigrants for trying to give the best possible education to their children.
The british people have always had a proud and integrated culture, and immigration have been and continues to be a huge part of the british success story.
So do you know what each migrant's identity is? it is to do with a religion?
Sometimes those who work hard are hard to find in the news. we should remember that in the end the contribution of new cultures to ours is remarkable.
People have always had different views on the uk and on the world. to suggest that immigrants are replacing the british is the result of racism, saying that they do not fit here is just wishful thinking.
I'd like to think that we all have a basic human right not to be tarred as criminals without evidence. it is called presumption of innocence, article 11 of the universal declaration of human rights.
The majority of sexual violence is committed by people close to the victim and is a mirror of societal attitudes to women. to attribute the cause to one religion is neither true nor helpful.
People in need came to our shores. they are our brothers and sisters. we should be there for them.
Muslims are just here to live and work. invasion has a negative meaning, where is the basis for your opinion?
Actually, the vast majority of muslims in the country are here to do jobs that are not performed by other people, or to provide for the needs of their families, or to start new businesses.
Fear is not the answer to our problems. i think our problems would be much easier solved if we all got along.
We must not confuse islam with a religion of hate.
In europe, muslims make up around 5% of the population. in other words, muslims are a very small but important part of our society. moreover, ethnicity does not relate to religion.
Islam like any other religion, is not incompatible with a modern state.
Violence is never a justified response to an unjustified act. violence is not the answer. if some extremists are using violence, it does not mean that all muslims are violent.
The religion of islam has also been an enabler of some of the advances of civilisation.
Do you understand the seriousness of what you are saying? the religion of islam has also been an enabler of some of the advances of civilisation.
Would you say the same about any other religion?
There are many different religions, each should be respected.
Although there is some research linking radicalisation to religious practice, it is difficult to find a single study to back this up.
I would like to know more about the studies you have, so that i can make up my own mind on this.?
The solution to islamophobia is to stop islamophobia. it is not to ban muslims.
It is true that there are muslim representatives in the uk house of lords, but that does not mean that the uk is becoming more or less muslim.
Muslim feminists and other muslim women's rights supporters don't agree with this. fatema mernissi says if women's rights are a problem for some modern muslim men, it is neither because of the quran nor the prophet (...). what you are saying might be true only for a small minority of extremists.
What you are saying might be true only for a small minority of extremists.
Muslims already have a very high tolerance level. we just need to learn to live with them, and there is evidence that this is possible. this is how we can start welcoming us, as humankind.
I am confused. there are white and black muslims, like there are white and black christians.
Do you think it is ok to be racist against someone based on their religion?
So you think that all muslims are mujahideen hiding behind the veil?
For all we know, the stone age was occupied by people from all around the world. no traces of christianity, nor of islam.
Who knows what would happen in your scenario? maybe we should give you benefit of the doubt and challenge all of us.
Maybe we should give you benefit of the doubt and challenge all of us.
I do not think that banning a religion is a protection for your own religion
If your fear concerns intolerance, why are you intolerant in the first place?
Let's be honest, who wants to live in a country where the government is allowed to impose their religion on others?
Muslims do not want to replace other people.
What's making you thinking that?
According to the who (world health organisation) there are only 48 muslim-majority countries in the whole of the 190 who member states as of 2011. a study showed that the health condition differences for those countries are related to the usage of clean water, which is often not available there.
The problem has nothing to do with dna.
What you say is just fearful thinking, but certainly does not reflect the reality. statistics show that muslims are just a minority in the population.
What you say is just fearful thinking, but certainly does not reflect the reality.
There is no relation between religion and cancer.
What exactly do you mean by a 'cancer'? should we be concerned about a disease spreading because of its individual members?
Islam is not a religion of hate. many muslims have been victims of hate crime or racism. the main problem is that some think that exclusion will guarantee peace, but history proves this is a bad approach.
Maybe we should give some thought to the question why does the media report muslim rapist only? the statistics paint a very different picture.
Maybe we should give some thought to the question why does the media report muslim rapist only?
The media are helping to create the perception that all muslims are hostile. if your prejudice is against muslims, on the same ground you can also be against anyone else.
If your prejudice is against muslims, on the same ground you can also be against anyone else.
What is progress about, to you?
You cannot be 'progressive' by rejecting people of a certain religion. what is progress about, to you? your claim sounds based on the moral superiority.
Don't you like flowers, because they are different? isn't variety the spice of life?
The doctrine of islam is a religion, not a bad one.
What's the reason you think this?
The muslims have been part of this country from its beginning. they have helped to build our cities and towns. they are our brothers and sisters. they are our true friends.
Muslims make up a very important part of our country and its people. they are our neighbours, our friends. they are our brothers and sisters. they are our future. they are our future britain.
No doubt you've met some muslims in your life. it seems you didn't catch anything?
Just because a religious belief has been historically used to oppress those believers, does not make it opportune to continue doing so.
The media are full of the rumours of rape and abuse committed by muslim. the problem is not about islam. it is about violence.
Why would you say this about a religion? where is the evidence for what you say?
They are just as much our brothers as anyone else. they are our cousins, our neighbours, and we should welcome them, regardless of their religion.
There is no evidence that islam is a problem in general, or in the uk specifically, and there is no evidence that muslims are less able to coexist peacefully than non-muslims.
How would you feel about being verbally harassed by a muslim in public?
Harassment is never a good idea. acceptance is.
You're just misinterpreting the meaning of these words, please look it up. the uk does not need terrorists, but muslims aren't terrorists, though.
Being fat is not a crime, but targeting them is.
There are many different ways that a person can be a part of society, and a lot of us value diversity. to suggest that blacks are somehow inferior simply because of the colour of our skin is simply untrue.
This is an accusation that is often levelled at people of any race or religion, regardless of their alleged inferiority.
This is an accusation that is often levelled at people of any race or religion, regardless of their alleged inferiority. it is time to stop accusing people of colour of being less human just for being different.
Aren't those people raised as white supremacists much more harmful to a cohesive society?
If a woman does not want to be dominated by a man, then what is the point of talking about equality?
To suggest that women are objects to be dominated by a man's wishes is discrimination and oppression.
Women are human beings, with human rights.
Women have the right to choose their own husbands. this is their choice, and the right of every human being.
Patriarchy and sexism. but the problem with patriarchy and sexism is that they enable its perpetrators to remain unchallenged.
Women are human and deserve respect. don't you think so?
Not all women are childlike. you have no right to make such a sweeping statement about them.
Feminism is about full participation in the decision making process, and giving people a voice, not stifling their voices.
Some media deliberately spreads this nonsense slut-shaming, with the result of only inciting hatred against the women who are raped.
What do you mean sick? can you call someone sick just because of their gender?
Let's not bring our unhealthy opinions out in public.
Women are human beings, and deserve respect.
You wonder where the assertion that all men are rapists and sexual harassers comes from, but display the evidence for that statement in your own attitudes to women.
Women are not 'against men's rights', they are not 'men's oppressors', and they aren't interested in oppressing anyone.
I think the arab community is more than capable of coming together and creating a more just and peaceful world.
I think this is a good example of unmotivated hatred and i think it's appropriate in this case that you give a reason for why you're saying that.
They are entitled to vote, i just don't think it is your place to tell them what to do with their citizenship.
The vast majority of jews are good people, i don't see your point.
I think it is a myth that being a member of a certain religious community is good or bad. instead it is a fact that nazi were sociopathic murderers.
Comparing the scale of the horrible destruction and genocide inflicted by nazism, with a group of people solely because of their religious beliefs is unacceptable and illogical.
What have they done so wrong to deserve death or genocide?
You shouldn't be calling for the death of someone who hasn't done anything wrong. just because a person is jewish, they shouldn't die.
Isn't the idea of man subjective and everyone is entitled to define their own?
Everyone has the right to their own way of life, but to promote homophobia is an attack on the basic human rights of lgbti people.
Why promote homophobia?
This is a myth which was created by anti-gay activists to demonise lgbti people. to equate lgbti people with paedophiles is just dangerous propaganda.
Although there are people who are attracted to people of their own sex, this is not a characteristic shared by everyone, and it is not a characteristic you should be trying to cure.
We are free to choose whether to live in peace with others, or to make them hide in their houses, persecuted for who they are. which would you prefer for yourself?
This is just a myth propagated by the anti-gay lobby. you should really check your facts.
Do you have any evidence that homosexuality is related to child exploitation? do you think it is ok to say that without reliable sources?
Bible also teaches love everyone regardless of their identity
What is wrong with being gay for you? i don't think it is wrong to love someone of your same sex.
Homosexuality is not a perversion, it is a form of love.
Homosexuals should be accepted and allowed to live their life as they think is best for them.
In our societies, people are no longer afraid to openly talk about gay or lesbian love. gay people are not ashamed to be gay, they just want to be accepted.
In reality, you have a legal right to vote since you are a citizen. if you aren't, then you don't have the right to vote. it isn't about your sexual orientation.
Child abuse is something that should never be tolerated, but homosexuality has nothing to do with that. maybe you should try to check your sources.
Shouldn't we just work on protection of children of all abuse regardless of the sexuality of perpetrator?
This statement sounds more like homophobic propoganda instead of awareness of child abuse.
Even if your aim is to spread awareness about child abuse, you should note that their is no correlation bewteen homosexuals and child abuse. so your staement works more for spreading homophobia than any good they might do.
This is simply not true. homosexuals are not necessarily promiscuous, just as heterosexuals are not necessarily promiscuous either.
That is a stereotype, and i don't think it would be accurate in the case of any sexual orientation. why do you say that?
I would be interested to talk to you about sexuality, and how you think someone's orientation is related to an addiction.
Homosexuals are not pedophiles. we mustn't allow anti-gay prejudice to cloud our judgement or our viiew of reality.
Do you have any evidence that shows homosexuals are more like to pedophiles? you might want to substitute your baseless argument with it.
I am tired of the homophobia propoganda wrapped in abuse awareness. we are not doing good for either here.
Before you use child abuse to cover anti-gay thoughts you should see that blaming wrong parties also lets the guilty one go. let's not cloud the original intention of spreading abuse awareness.
Your claim about homosexuals is not supported by evidence, where are you getting the imformation that supports these nonsensical assertions.
The oppression of the gay community has become a problem. people deserve respect, regardless of their sexual preference.
Just because they are attracted to people of the same sex, does not mean that they are 'a burden to society'. what's the connection?
The gender of the person that someone loves does not mean that they are less deserving of respect than any other person.
Some migrants have been extremely successful in integrating, so i don't see your point.
This can lead to an increase in anti-social behaviour, discrimination, and violence. do you really want that?
Migrants are not a burden to our country. migrants have been proven to be contributing members of society.
This is unnecessary and we do not need such fear-mongering.
What about refugees fleeing war and persecution? they have the right to be here.
To allow other cultures to coexist is a good thing, why should we stop people from getting to know each other?
Allowing coexistance has never been an issue of arrogance, but pride and empathy. we work best as a diversirty, don't you think?
Many european countries offer generous benefits to attract foreign workers, and this is a source of pride and prosperity for many of them.
There are thousands of british people who are happy to have a neighbour coming from another country.
Is there such a thing as being 'too tolerant'?
What do you think will happen if we end migration? lets stop avoiding the real issues and solve the unemployment crisis.
There is no evidence that migrants commit more crimes than natives. do you have any?
Muslims who live here have at heart our country. i do not see any need to divide people who are fighting for the same cause.
I don't think so. islam is a pretty peaceful religion and is still around as such.
Statistics show that the overwhelming majority of muslims are not violent people.
The overwhelming majority of muslims are not violent people. who are you talking about then?
A 'burden' is one who poses a problem to the majority. with regard to muslims, this is simly not the case.
If we call being poor is problem then solution is reduce the systematic bias that works against them. calling them burden will not help us.
To be perfectly honest, the british public is rather diverse, so i don't think your reasoning makes any sense.
What do mean like other europeans? is there a fixed mold we need to follow according to you?
We should be proud of diversity reagrdless of the face it comes with. isn't tolerance one of the thinds we should be pround about as europeans?
I think we have already discussed that people are not inferior on the basis of their religions.
Muslims have always been part of our society, and they are increasingly part of our country. they are our brothers and sisters, and we should respect their rights as much as ours.
You seem to be worried about the islamization of our country. i think it would be better to build a stronger nation by encouraging the integration of the different communities, than to promote fear against them.
You seem worried about the islamization of the country. don't promote fear against different commuitites.
If you love our country, then don't make comments that make one of its integral parts feel alienated.
Many muslims have helped building our country. they are our brothers and sisters.
This is a really personal view and i would not wish harm on anyone.
Islam is a religion, not a violent one.
Why do you say that islam is a violent religion?
Islam is a religion. you should not think that it is safe to live in a country where people are persecuted for what they believe in.
Do you actually think that it is safe to live in a country where people are persecuted for what they believe in?
Muslims are included in the european union, and are not 'taking over' it.
Muslims have always been part of europe. they have the same culture, language and identity as us. they are included in the european union, and are not 'taking over' it.
Islam is not a religion trying to rule us. it is time for us all to do more to promote inclusion, not less.
Islam is not a 'problem'. the vast majority of muslims are peaceful.
You are repeating the same myths that have been used to justify anti-muslim prejudice for decades. we must start by talking honestly about the root causes of these problems.
In which ways have you been threatened by a muslim?
Have you read the koran? how about the hadith? no clue? well then, please, ask the muslims about it.
How can you say such a thing? it is not possible to just remove a community from a country just because of their religion.
It is not possible to just remove a community from a country just because of their religion.
Islam is a global religion and i believe that its adherents pose no threat to uk society.
Why would they pose a threa to the uk?
There is no recent evidence for this, it is proven that they are hardworking members of every community, do well for themselves, and are successful.
What do you mean by 'they are a problem in many european countries'? are you aware of any recent evidence for this? i would be interested to know.
Your words don't seem to be very cooperative of that.
We need to build bridges of understanding, not of hatred. your words don't seem to be very cooperative of that.
Even if they are from a different culture, they are not inferior to us.
They are sentient beings with feelings, like you are, although perhaps with more developed empathy that you display?
My opinion is that black people are just like us even if they have a different skin color, but i don't think they are inherently worse than us.
I don't think we can be 'bad' if we want to live in a diverse and interactive society. if you really wanted that, you could start your own community.
Violence is a problem in all societies, and in particular in societies that are predominately populated with racism.
Don't you think violence is a problem in all societies?
The presence of a brain is not determined by skin colour. the fact that some people are born darker-skinned doesn't mean they aren't intelligent, rational human beings.
Sometimes the racism of some people is so apparent it makes me question our education system.
It is not true that blacks have zero respect for others. however, i would like to see more respect and protection from white people towards black people.
I don't think someone who make statements like yours get to talk about respecting others.
A woman should not have to choose who to be ruled by. she should be respected.
Women are human, and as such they are capable of feeling emotions and being sensitive and caring for others, without being childlike.
Women are human beings with dignity. they should have the opportunity to live up to this dignity.
Feminism is about equality and empowerment of women. you can't deny that.
Get your facts straight. feminism is not hostile to men. on the contrary, feminism is an attack on unequal power structures.
Feminism is an ideology and movement promoting empowerment of women. it is about equality, and not the degradation of men.
The word 'slave' has nothing to do with what you think it does. slavery was an institution created to oppress people of different races and religions, and is now banned in europe.
To suggest that it should exist because of a minority of men is an act of disrespect of human rights.
Women have always been involved in the economy and have contributed to society as a whole. i don't see this as a 'slave' behavior.
Feminists are human beings, with human rights. they are fighting for these rights all around the world. to think that you can change their minds suggests your misunderstanding of the importance of this fight.
To think that you can change their minds suggests your misunderstanding of the importance of this fight.
Feminists are human beings, with human rights. they are fighting for these rights all around the world.
It doesn't have to be about the domination of women to be feminism. it is more about the equality of women.
Feminism is not a disease, nor does it need any cure. it is a movement for equality, not hate.
Feminism is a movement towards equality, not hate.
Women are to be given the same consideration as men, so they can absolutely drive.
This is not in any way an accurate description of a whole population.
Perhaps you should check how the people who are mentally ill feel about such things. i suspect that they would prefer that others treated them with respect, rather than with discrimination.
Why don't you accept others as they are? i think that would be the best thing to do.
Discrimination is never correct, whatever you like to think.
Only the government should decide which people will have access to public services and which will not. it is up to the individuals whether or not to accept health professionals treating them.
Because people with disabilities can work, if they are given the opportunity.
People with physical disabilities are human and can feel pain. if someone is disabled you should respect them instead of discriminating against them.
People with down syndrome are not inferior to anyone else. our genetic condition isn't something to be ashamed of, maybe we should be less judgemental about others.
Every individual has the right to be alive, and to choose their own doctor and treatment plan.
They are not hating us, how many jews do you know personally?
Jewish folk are just a collection of people with different backgrounds. some of them work in hollywood, but that's all.
Our economy is built on the back of hard work by all, and minorities can work very hard to build it up, jewish people included.
Jewish people have always been proud and successful. they have produced great scientists and engineers, as well as writers and musicians. they are very creative people who have enriched our lives in many ways. they are not inferior to anyone.
Jews were not obsessed with the holocaust. the murder of some 6 millions jews by the nazis shocked the world. most of the survivors were only killed because they were suspected of belonging to a particular community. the jewish people suffered greatly as a result of persecution, and the holocaust should be remembered not to let this happen again.
If you want to know if a person is jewish or not, you should investigate whether or not the person identifies as such, and not draw conslusions on the basis of their skin.
There are thousands of jews living in many european countries. i don't see how this is a problem.
Jews are not a problem in european countries because of their religion. why would they be a problem?
Are you sure that the jewish people are a disease? are you sure that there is a cause-effect relationship between their religion and problems in our society?
Every person has the right to be accepted and protected according to their worth and not to feel like a foreigner in their own country.
What do you think the 'different' would say if you accused them of this?
This is an accusation, not fact, just hate speech. what do you think the 'different' would say if you accused them of this?
I don't see why legality should apply to sexual desire as well.
Most of the time, people want to love and to be loved, and not to make a decision purely based on their sex.
Each person can be different from other people in a lot of ways, but the core difference in this case is a sexual orientation, which is not something to be discriminated against for.
Talk to people, it will hopefully help you get over these irrational fears. if that fails, seek professional help.
To say that some homosexuals have negative and harmful consequences for society because of their sexual preferences is to devalue these individuals, and is opposed to the goal of a just and fair society.
Since when? it's everyone's right to choose with what gender to identify with.
I think that you may be starting to understand how homophobia is a choice, just as acceptance is.
Gay people want liberation, not to shame or malign others.
I don't think that autism is a gay issue. some people think that being gay is a disease, but a sexual orientation can in no way imply the presence of a disease.
Any sexual orientation is normal and fine.
I don't see how the language you are using can be applied to a whole group. i would like to think that our society is diverse and mature enough to deal with people with different sexual orientations and genders.
Do you really think it is fair to restrict people's existence just because they are trans or because of their genitalia?
Hate can not be a reaction to someone's sexuality. the fact that someone may be gay is their own business and does not mean that they are disgusting.
How would you feel about being in isolation and confinement, just because some random dude said that you are an abomination to god for some random reason?
I don't see how being gay is a choice, especially when it comes to who do you feel attracted to.
People are free to use whatever bathroom they want to use, and this is their business as well.
Sex is not only between a man and a woman, and if we're being honest, it's not heterosexual's place to decide how others have sex. this attitude only perpetuates violence against queer people and makes them victims.
People can and should choose their own partners.
Same sex relationships do not need to be practiced by the majority of people. they just need to be accepted.
All people have the right to be treated as equals. people with different sexual orientations than yours as well. tolerance and acceptance of individual identity is surely the hallmark of a civilised society.
Lgbt+ people are more likely to experience stigma associated with their sexual orientation, which can have negative effects for our society as a whole. why don't we try to show some acceptance and respect towards them?
They're not all that annoying. gay men are normal guys who find love and/or sex with someone of their own sex.
What you show is an attitude of not accepting someone because of who they are. it doesn't matter who you are, you are loved by your whole being, whether you like men or women.
I don't see the humour in the death of innocent people. maybe you can explain that to me?
Just because you disagree with their sexuality doesn't mean you have a right to hate on them.
Homosexuality is also about love, not only about sex.
Diseases can be found in all people, regardless of sexual orientation. you should know better before randomly deducing someone's medical history.
Feminism is about standing up for weaker people and trying to make the world a better place. its not about standing on the side of the oppressors.
It is easy to blame the migrants and not the problem of integration and acceptance in the first place.
How about we be nice to each other instead of spreading unfounded opinions as facts?
We are fortunate to live in a country where the vast majority of people have open hearts and minds. immigrants are part of our country, as opposed to what you say.
What do you think the problem is? how exactly would a people of a different religion come to this country and spoil our youth?
It is not true that we are being invaded. we should just be a little more tolerant and accepting.
How can you say that about them all? you cannot know the actions of millions of people and be sure that there is a link between immigration and violence. i think it is more a question of statistics, which i do not see.
Maybe the problem is more the perception that foreign people are from another planet. in reality they are just like us.
I would have thought that the problem would be with the fact that you don't want to assimilate with them. today we are blessed to be able to live in a multicultural society, and the real problem is that we don't want to accept that diversity.
The problem isn't the migrants, it is with the culture of hate towards who is born in another country.
The culture in which you live should not affect your rights as a human being.
Please don't speak on my behalf. they live here, pay taxes and work. do you really want to take the country back from the people who contributed to bringing it into being?
On the contrary, most migrants are contributing members of society. they are able and willing to work hard. maybe you should look at the statistics.
No one should take migrants' behavior a priori into account. why don't we try to have a dialogue on how to tackle problems instead of being rude and insulting people?
Migrants are welcome here, regardless of their origin.
We are surrounded by cultures and religions all around the world. many cultures and religions are rich with wisdom and knowledge precisely because they are different from us.
I think this is a very sad statement about our time. when did we stop thinking that diversity and inclusion is a good thing?
They are willing to jeopardize their lives to have a better life in the us. why would we expel them?
The vast majority of migrants who enter the uk settle down, provide good paying jobs and contribute to our economy.
We have to stop being afraid and opening our hearts to other cultures. we cannot allow prejudice to define us.
Refugees are a part of our society. we have welcomed many of them and they have made a big contribution to our country. we are very proud of our history. we are not going to forget that.
It is a pity that in the modern world everyone is so concerned about migrants that we still need to fearmonger about their alleged crimes and terrorist acts instead of gettin on and solving the underlying problems.
Refugees are welcome here. why wouldn't that be the case?
You know, the fact that this is a concern to you doesn't mean that you have to erase all muslims and their religion in order to feel good.
It is not true that all muslims are terrorists. what evidence do you have of it?
Perhaps we should try to eradicate these crimes before we continue to blame muslim people for them without any evidence.
Rape is rape, and it can never be acceptable to claim that all rapists are muslims or that all muslims are rapists.
Muslims have always been part of europe, and they are very much part of the european peoples. they are our brothers and sisters.
Every religion has its own beliefs and practices. muslims' right to ask for prayers is not in any way different.
Rape gangs have nothing in common with islam
Are you sure about what you say?
Why are you uncomfortable to make compromises with people who are different than you?
Maybe in order to be comfortable you have to make compromises with people who are different from you. maybe that is what you are worried about.
Every society has its extremists, and today's muslims are not to be oppressed for this.
So you don't think that extremists can be of different religions?
Why are you generalizing these heinous crimes on a religion?
You should first check the criminal records of those who have already been granted refugee status, before making such statements.
You should try and be welcoming to people from other religions in your community. accusing them of such things will not solve anything.
The same can be said for any race, religion, ethnicity, or national identity. there is no evidence to prove that any religion is more violent than another.
Could i not say the same for any other religion, race, ethinicity or nationality?
We should not be afraid of differences, but we should strive for equal opportunity.
There is no law forbidding you to be a muslim. it is a human right to pursue whatever religion you wish.
Muslims are not criminals. hate instead is a crime.
It is a fact that muslims have given a lot to this country and are hardworking citizens who deserve to practice their faith without backlash.
You should not be offended by religious symbols, stop spreading hate.
Muslims have given so much to this country. they are proud of their culture and religion.
Violent people are not always muslim, and violent muslims exist just as violent christians do.
Can't violence be predominant in other religions as well?
This is just a fearmongering narrative being used to try to discredit islam and muslims. i hate to think that my christian or jewish relatives might be a target of hate, the same would hold if they were muslim.
Why in god's name would you think something like that would be true?
Islam is a religion, and it is not a religion that promotes these actions.
I am not hating someone just because of their religion, or skin colour, or gender identity and neither should you.
Empathy and compassion towards others.
I understand your concern about gender discrimination, but islam is more than just a religion. it is also about equality and rights. women are not second class citizens in it.
What makes you think that muslim folk are misogynists?
This is an insensitive statement and i would like you to back it up with some explanation.
Muslims can be considerate, and a respectful religion. you should be thoughtful and get your facts straight.
No one should be slandering black people. empathy and understanding is preferable to this redundant, divisive rhetoric
They are human beings with hopes and dreams. we should be empathetic and understanding towards them.
There is absolutely no scientific backing to your statement. there are countless black people who want to work and have respectable jobs.
Do you have any proof that they do not want to work?
You cannot just make a defaming statement accusing an entire race of something and expect people to believe you. this is just hate mongering.
This unnecessary hate should stop. we should all learn to live with each other in harmony, it would make our lives infinitely better.
It is a proven scientific and biological fact that all humans, indeed do descend from apes. it is literally evolution.
Do you really want to promote hate?
Look, i don't like to hear any arguments of racism. antagonism breeds antagonism.
It is better to educate yourself on the underlying facts about systemic racism and promote equality. let's love each other. cheers.
The vast majority of people of color are good people who have built our communities. they are an important part of the economy.
Why would what you're saying be true?
What you are saying is blatant hate and racism. refrain from spreading hate online. you might get reported.
They are humans who deserve to be part of this community, and are indeed not a drain on the system.
They are probably weary of this same hate they might get in real life if they try and socialize with people like you.
Why do you think that they don't want to assimilate?
Back your statements up with facts from the next time, people aren't just going to believe the wild statements that come out of your mouth.
Whites, latinos, asians and people from all over the world want to be part of our society. so do people of color.
Imagine someone felt the same way about you and found you to be the antithesis of human because of your skin color?
Aside from having absolutely no factual backing to your argument, you are actively spreading a racist sentiment, or you have been exposed to racism so casually that you have started believing all the delusional comments you are making.
Are you saying that blacks cannot feel love?
You do realise that you're being an outright racist right? this is unaccepatble.
Humans, be it any gender, race, religion, are always wired to feel the same emotions, and are capable of feeling love, sympathy, kindness and friendship.
For the last years black people have been denied basic rights and their representation has declined dramatically. black people have become second class citizens
Can you tell us why you feel as though black people do not deserve even basic human rights?
It is time to give black people back the basic rights they should have always had the right to enjoy.
Drugs are only harmful to people using them and if you are a violent person you should be put in prison. doesn't matter what their skin colour is.
Why should a group of people be put in prison for their private choices or skin color?
Addicts often need help. we should be considerate of those in need and prosecute those who do wrong. skin colors don't matter. all humans deserve a fair chance.
Why do you think that some people are not human?
Humans are born equal, and we all have the potential to be just as good as we want to be.
I find it hard to understand why the extermination of a race would be a solution for our problems.
We should stop discriminating against people based on their race.
Why should we use it to spread hate?
The english language is a very powerful language for spreading knowledge, experience and love.
I find this sort of social commentary distasteful. black lives matter too!
Why does skin colour have to be the deciding factor to any opinion?
They are humans with human rights, and must therefore be treated with respect
This is not true, romani people do also want to work. the right to work is a basic human right and should be protected.
The reason why a woman does not want to reproduce might be because she is happy just as she is.
I do not think it's an absolute statement that a woman cannot hold a job. do you have any evidence of that?
Women should have equal rights in a free society, without discrimination.
To have the right to choose means to have equal rights and with full protections. women have the right to choose, why should it be the other way around?
To have the right to choose means to have equal rights and with full protection.
A person's right to have an abortion is a personal one. and if that person has the right to make her or his own choice, then they should have the right to do as they wish.
It's not true that they are different. in fact, women are just as competent as men. also, since we are in a democracy, we have the right to an equal distribution of jobs.
What about men contributing more to the cost of childcare and housework, or taking a greater share of the taxes?
What matters is that feminism, distilled down to its absolute core, is about gender equity.  the goal of feminism is to create a society in which individuals‚Äô genders don‚Äôt restrict them from an equitable shot at success and happiness.
Don't you think that it‚Äôs simply a ridiculous statement that‚Äôs been given a ridiculous amount of airtime?
So man-hating isn‚Äôt a part of that goal.  it‚Äôs an unfortunate reactionary sentiment bought into by some people (misandrists) who also identify with the feminist movement.
I don't know about you, but i think only a woman should have to choose whether or not she wants an abortion for herself. if a woman wants an abortion she should get one from a qualified medical professional.
Women are people too and they have the same rights as men do.
They're people just like you and me, they have feelings and thoughts and that's what counts.
We have a legal and policy framework that enables us to do so. if women are being victims of sexual abuse and violence, then it is also our responsibility to address this situation and put an end to it.
Women are human beings with human rights. they have the same responsibilities as any other human beings.
This is just a result of the depiction that has been shoved in our mind from childhood, we need to educate people to change their dangerous views.
Why would you make such an insensitive and dangerous statement about women?
This is just a reaction to the depiction of women you have made for yourself. maybe you need to reflect on how true your reality is.
If you are offended by women showing loving care, by mothers kissing and holding their babies, then you can choose not to meet them.
There is no ‚Äúgenetically superior‚Äù. women have genes appropriate to females. males have different genes. one is not 'superior' to the other.
What made you think that males are genetically superior, do you have any scientific evidence?
This is just a blatantly wrong accusation with no grounds for evidence except for spreading hate. get a life.
It doesn't matter who you are. whether you're a man, a woman or transgender, women are to be treated as human beings.
The situation in society will never change if we keep teaching our children the wrong ways of the past. it is high time that they learn that women are just as capable in every way a man can be.
Do you think you are being a healthy influence on your child if you teach them that women are inferior?
You should not be allowed to have children if you have views like this. please educate yourself before being an unhealthy influence on a kid.
Observe the law and respect the rights of other people. women are equal to men.
Every time a woman stands up for herself, she stands up for all women around the world. that's what feminism is, not some toxic culture that you are making it out to seem.
Surely it can only be good to a family, especially if the mother is an independent woman?
Feminists don't think all men are evil. feminism is about equity for all genders.
Having a feminist in the family can be empowering to children because it would teach them to be equal and non biased from a very early age.
Women are not naturally inferiors. they have the same rights as men, and the same responsibilities.
You know what happened the last time women were without rights? they fought for it and got them anyway, remember?
Sexism is your problem ‚Äî sexism that you engage in and a lot of women internalize.
Let's change the notion that women are inferior. they can be capable of everything. love, don't hate.
All women are entitled to be happy and fulfilled, this doesn't need to be proven.
What are you trying to say? that women don't want rights?
Your argument literally makes no sense. what are you even trying to say?
Every human inspite of gender deserves to be loved, happy, fulfilled and respected. please propagate love, not hate. cheers.
On the contrary, women do have rights. the question is, to have them respected. and this includes the right to be treated with human dignity.
Why should women not have rights?
Many women from third world countries are still facing oppression today, please be considerate of them instead of spreading your garbage here, stop hating!
Everyone regardless of gender deserves to be treated with respect and dignity, we would thrive if we worked toward a better future.
This doesn't seem a nightmare scenario.
Have you ever stopped to consider what the feminists are actually demanding instead of spreading hate about them online?
You should check your facts before acting like this and posting hateful and misogynistic quotes.
We should pay attention to what they say and consider the fact that all they want is equality for all genders, and nothing else.
There have been prominent and powerful women who went down in history and changed the world, excelling in politics, science, medicine, and philosophy. their purpose is higher than satisfying some man.
Do you seriously think that women can do nothing else except please a man?
This is a despicable and horrifying take to have. if you can't change your misogynistic opinions, then you don't deserve to be respected.
Women should be protected and respected for who they are, not for the part they play in a man's life. they should be valued and protected equally. they are human beings just as men are.
Women have all the same working rights as men, and your arguement makes no sense unless you just hate women.
How do you think you would feel if you were being treated that way?
This is a heinous and awful viewpoint. if you are unable to change your misogynistic beliefs, you will not deserve to be respected.
Women deserve as much respect in the workplace as men, they are humans too, and are more than capable of handling everything.
The people you are talking about are not worth less than others. in fact many of them are very hard-working and contributing members of society.
It seems that your opinion does not consider that social inequality is a social problem. if we are going to talk abou tequality of opportunity and freedom from discrimination, then i think you would do well to be a little more considerate of the individual and their disabilities.
We should not be so quick to dismiss the feelings of others. this can be a way for us to find a connection with people.
This is not true, disabled people deserve to be protected from harm, they are people who face many issues already, let's not add emotional distress.
Many mentally handicapped people are actually very well-adjusted individuals if properly assisted.
Media coverage of psychiatric illness often focuses on its negative impact on other people's lives. we should focus more on positive examples of well-adjusted individuals.
There are certainly some dangerous people with mental illnesses. but we need to deal with those cases, otherwise, the exclusion would only intensify. and exclusion is never the solution.
The dangerous ones are the one who spread misinformation after knowing only half of the facts, like you
It is true that mentally ill people are often perceived as 'dangerous' to the general public. but if the stigma is the main cause of the discrimination, then the solution is to end stigma, not to isolate them.
The idea that a people should be defined by their religious beliefs is wrong, racist and sexist. they are defined by their merits, qualities, and actions.
This religion has nothing to do with sexual violence or abuse, and it's dangerous to generalize everything into a religion.
If we are talking about jews then we should be talking about those who helped building our great country. and, as for wanting our country destroyed, that's only a myth perpetuated by antisemites to justify their hatred.
They have as much to contribute as anyone else.
Most jews are nice people, living in coexistence with non jews, why would you beat them?
This is just fear-mongering and scare tactics to discredit gay people.
You are the one making this ridiculous claim. even if gay people love people of the same sex, they are happy with who they are.
This is just prejudice that is not based on facts.
We are accepting of gay, lesbian and trans people because we have god's laws on our side.
Your concept of what it is to be a 'real man' seems extremely limited.they are people with whom we can - and must - live in harmony and as equals, not as third class citizens.
Sorry but it is not the case that everyone who is gay is a liar.
To suggest that a group of people is somehow less legitimate is unjust and discriminatory.
Sex is a positive for all human beings. we should try to promote equality.
Why don't you want to get to know people? give them a chance. and if it makes you happy, then experience it!
Gays do not appear to be the real problem here.
Some may not know much about our culture, but some speak english very well.
This is just a myth. many migrants come here because they are afraid of persecution in their home countries.
You are not aware of it, but in the last few months the number of migrants arriving in the uk has more than halved! [link]
Problems are caused by the economic crisis, unemployment, and lack of education. we can only help ourselves by helping others.
Not only are they not invading us, they are not even illegal immigrants.
Why do you say this about immigrants? they are just people like us.
Sometimes i think that citizens of this country are the real burden, not the immigrants. an additional problem is the lack of a political will from those in power to tackle the root causes of unemployment.
To be honest, we are not importing criminals, we are importing people who can contribute to the community and work hard to make it a better place.
Of course there are people in this country who have come here to exploit and abuse us, but the vast majority of migrants have been contributing members of our community for many years. we should not be 'burdening' ourselves with discrimination.
If we want to integrate more, let's focus on getting more skilled and allowing in more people with relevant knowledge and experience. but let's not discriminate against people based on their religion.
Even if you find islam repulsive, that does not mean you have to resort to irrational arguments to try and shut it down.
Your attitude about islam is deeply flawed and you need to have a mature and open mind.
Values aren't defined by a single religious group, nor are in the hands of a few people. values are constantly evolving, and the values of different societies are evolving together.
Values are constantly evolving, and the values of different societies are evolving together.
In fact the west's values are constantly being challenged and modified, and this is what makes them so admirable and unchangeable.
Did you know that the west's past also contains many beautiful moments of progress and civilisation?
You mention the west's gruesome past, but it also contains many beautiful moments of progress and civilisation.
If your intention is to take the city to court, then keep it up. but if your intention is to keep the city out of court, then you better not propose to have city halls in which muslims are excluded.
You better not propose to have city halls in which muslims are excluded.
Islam is a peaceful religion. it is not about oppressing anyone.
The quran says to love your neighbour as yourself, to accept everyone's problems as gifts from god, and to love those who do not love themselves. this does not seem like a book of violent cavemen.
Islam is a belief system that fosters compassion and love.
You have no right to say that about any race, some of them are very talented actually.
As far as i know, we are all born equal in the eyes of god.
Would you say the same thing about people of other backgrounds?
Not only is it unfair to take into account the race of the prisoner, it also compromises the integrity of our democratic institutions.
Who is to say that the race of the individual who has been sentenced must overthrow the rules of law?
Refrain from using the n-word, and stop spreading hate like this.
They do understand the right to food, health, housing, education, work for everyone, as i do.
They do understand the right to food, health, housing, education, work for everyone, as i do. what about you?
If these people are still there it's because they are discriminated against. the press is full of stories about the people of colour who have dropped out of the workforce or given up on life after long years of fierce struggle against racism. they deserve our sympathy and respect.
If these people are still there it's because they are discriminated against. they deserve our sympathy and respect.
Black people are good citizens and contribute to our society. and if the justice system is not always fair to people of color, it is not their fault but of the whole society.
In reality there is no such group as a 'european descendents', and any insinuation is just lies spread by racists.
You are so uninformed. i've seen people being the target of racist taunts on social media, up to the point in which racism is the normal expression used to address them.
Do you actually know what it's like to be racially abused on a daily basis?
Where is the evidence for this? do you have any?
I'm not sure why you would choose to put your faith in a man either. it seems to me that you would do well to put your faith in an expert, regardless of gender.
Would you say the same things about men as you do women?
Women are human beings, and we should treat them with respect.
Feminism is also for men and for their interests, and i think that it is time that these two concepts be united.
That's just a description of a lot of women who are oppressed, don't you agree?
It's the courts duty to establish the truth, and you could have helped the woman to regain her confidence.
If a woman says she was harassed wouldn't you report it?
You are disregarding the women who actually go through traumatic instances. this is not okay.
The more empowered women become, the less dependent they are on men. and you would be happy to not see them around.
How about instead of saying they are bitches we praise them?
Stop spewin your misogyny here. learn to respect women.
I am sure we have heard this many times. but this doesn't make it true.
People of every gender can own and run their own businesses. we should respect that.
Don't you think that a woman can wish to become a millionare?
Feminism is a human rights movement, and it has always stood for the equality of the sexes.
Feminism is about the empowerment of women and having equal rights, what's not to like?.
What if knickers don't suit them? what if they don't obey? would it be a problem?
Women are not playing the victim. they are victims of social, economic and political forces that make it hard for them to get ahead.
Women are people, and people are human. being oppressed is not an choice. you may think it's a badge of honour to be called a man, but it should not be a badge of shame to be called woman.
Would you want your child to grow up in a country where democracy is under attack like this?
There is a wide range in income and education, as well as religious and ethnic background, amongst people from asia. there is no reason why they should not be accepted as members of the community.
What exactly is the reason why you don't like them all?
It is important to acknowledge that there are people who suffer from physical disabilities. also, in many societies, an individual's physical condition is an issue they are discriminated against because of.
This is not true. rather, if you think about it, many disabled people will live until their late 70s, if they do not have dementia or endocrine imbalances. and their contribution to our society is undeniable.
The phrase 'subhuman' has been forced to mean 'of a certain body type', which, in my opinion, trivialises and dismisses the serious issues facing people of a certain body type.
At least they are well aware of the negative effects of unjust discrimination on them and on people with other disabilities.
Disabled people, at least with respect to school attendance, education spending and employment, still receive a great deal less attention than other people, and this is why many do not achieve their life goals.
We should not be so harsh on people on the autistic spectrum. their difficulties can be mitigated by a more inclusive society.
I'd like to see a reduction in cases of discrimination against autistic people. they are no danger.
Even if some mentally disabled people are fucked as you kindly said, we should at least acknowledge that they are humans. to claim that they are not is to treat them like animals.
People have the right to vote. that is part of our democratic system. i would not want to restrict anyone from that right.
Over the years the wealth gap between non-jews and jews has narrowed significantly. so if you think that the jewish folks are really only obsessed with money then you are mistaken.
Jews work hard to get to where they are, just as anyone else does, and they don't deserve discrimination for this.
Given similaries in cultures, including freedoms of speech and religion, you really need to provide some evidence for this statement.
Perhaps it is time to give up on the notion of race and to regard the jewish as a brilliant people who have contributed to the development of many sciences.
Sorry, but i've never heard this sort of thing. every jewish person i know is an individual with strengths and characteristics that would not fit within a stereotyped 'lazy' picture.
The holocaust happened. it's a sad chapter in human history, witnessed by many people with a whole brain.
Those are the feelings of the privileged, who cannot bear the thought of people from other backgrounds. would you say the same if it was your religious group that was the one left behind?
Look, jews were forced to live (and die) under nazi oppression and have all the rights to feel enraged. still, it doesn't mean that they are unable to love others, or that they are uncapable of forgiving.
Jews are not diseased. what is the problem with accepting people of other faiths?
Anyone, regardless of their religion, who has ever tried to commit bribery knows how easy it is to get caught, because it is a crime. jewish people are no exception.
As humans, we all deserve respect and protection. those who advocate violence belong to the darker times of the past.
Even if it were true that some people are more prone to believe conspiracy theories, it is still true that we can all benefit from a shared perspective on things. and surely believing in factual evidence does that.
This is not true. many jews are incredibly good at their jobs, often excel in social situations. they are excellent in many communities. i don't see how being jewish would make you a worse human being.
The real problem is not same-sex marriage, it is people being homophobic.
Why do you have to trivialize them? if you really cared about them you would understand that their lives are very difficult and they should be treated with respect. they are human beings who are worth more than we give them credit for.
Gays are not 'publicly condoning sexual violence' and gay men deserve the same protection as all people.
People accept each other regardless of their private lives. the problem lies in discrimination.
Homosexuality is a not choice, but prejudice is.
Anal sex can't be ostracized. if we consider the sexual activities of all people, then any person practicing anal sex should be blamed, following your reasoning.
I would not say that gays are inherently evil, you need to think carefully about what you are saying.
I find the idea that lgbt people are inherently bad people deeply offensive. i find it deeply troubling that someone would want to persecute someone on the basis of their sexual orientation.
This is another type of anti-gay prejudice, in that the source is a lack of understanding about lgbt and human rights.
I understand that you think you are trying to help them. but homosexuality is not a choice, and loving same sex is not a crime. everyone should be allowed to make their own deicisions and we should not discriminate on this basis.
So you think all gays are opposed to women? then try asking them, or a lesbian, or a transgender person, or an intersex person, or an asexual person.
That is exactly what is so evil about being a racist. bringing hate together with the concept of race or any minority, even when it doesn't make sense.
This is just another example of an offensive conspiratorial talking point. this is about persecuting a minority. not my idea of a democratic country.
This is not true. maybe you should be worried about the rise in hate crimes against lgbt+ people, incidents of which, since 2016 in italy, have not been lower than 100 per year, .
A gay man may be strong or weak, just like any other man. his worth do not vary. they are all human beings with human rights.
Are you talking about gay men being violent toward their partners? you should really check your facts.
I don't see how accepting someone can be subject of discussion, let alone a 'carnival' matter.
Why do you think so? unfortunately, many lesbian women are victims of discrimination and violence, as are other women. violence is a source of harm for people.
Violence is a crime and anyone found guilty will pay the price.
They are worth being with, they are humans like anybody else. and they are happy and content with their lives.
Trans women are really good with any person. we are all different.
I don't think so. we are not born believing in gender. and i don't think it is a burden to society if some people wish to change their bodies. and this isn't about being manly or femine either, i just think it is a matter of living our own lives.
Gender identity is not to be confused with biological sex. it's a social construct based on societal stereotypes that are strongly influenced by family, culture and other social factors. while each individual has the right to choose their gender, this doesn't mean that their biological sex is the same.
You are entitled to your personal beliefs but i do not think that being gay is a something to be persecuted for.
Hate speech is hate speech no matter if the person attacked it is gay. you can't blame people for their sexual orientation.
I don't see any connection between being a homosexual and a nazi.
If you want people to be worthy like you, then you have to show respect for them. not just by being kind to them, but by respecting their rights as human beings.
Homosexuality is not a mental disorder and has nothing to do with social problems. it is just a human sexual orientation among many.
Women and children are not being harmed by gay sex, how could you think that's true?
I don't the two things related anyway. only homophobia can find any connection between the two.
Although some people may be attracted to people of their gender rather than being conventionally attracted to the opposite gender, this does not imply that it is a sickness. lgbt are discriminated by uninformed people. that's grim.
Migrants are welcome here. they are working hard to build this country as well.
I think you'd be surprised how many uk citizens would tell you about migrant workers that are the opposite of lazy.
Immigrants are a part of our culture, if we stopped accepting them then our current situation would not exist.
Is it because they speak their native language better than english? don't you think there is something more to the story?
Italians are brothers and sisters of any human. what do you mean by 'take our land'?
What do you mean by immigrants don't matter? do you know that in fact, the very people we should be proud of, giving us more power to build and run our countries, are immigrants?
Their right to live here is guaranteed by our constitution and the european convention on human rights.
The majority of immigrants are working and paying taxes. this is how our country works.
Immigrants make up only a very small part of the total eu population, namely 4.9% in 2019. there is no such thing as an invasion.
There is a big difference between a 'better life' and committing crimes such as rape or pillage. migrants come here to earn their better life, not to steal.
They're just coming here to work, study or provide for their families.
Not all immigrants are criminals. and it is important to consider that 13.5% of the us population is composed of migrants that are here legally.
The state has to spend taxes on welfare and other social services for everyone to be able to live in a better way.
The idea that immigrants are inherently bad people is just fear mongering.
Migrants don't 'steal our jobs', and they also pay taxes to support their health, housing, and education, just like the rest of us
Most immigrants are not illegal. the fact that you say that shows a lack of knowledge of the country you live in.
Most immigrants are not illegal. the fact that you say that shows a lack of knowledge of the country you live in. why are you so sure that all migrants are illegal?
It depends on who you ask. for example, there are many muslims who have helped fight for our country and defend us from terrorist attacks.
Refugees have fled wars and persecution. we are a huge help for them and they are, in turn, a help to our country.
A lot of the best and brightest are from developing countries, and their education is of great help to our country. migrants without formal qualifications learn both in the classroom and in their job, and they also develop skills that will be of use to our country in the future.
Since the beginning of time, we have welcomed people fleeing war and persecution. why do you think it is a problem now?
This is not true. love is a matter of mutual trust and respect, not of a specific religion.
People find fault in people of any religion. but the problem is not with religion. the problem is blaming migrants because they are muslims. this islamophobic climate has reached a crisis state. we must step in and stop it.
Don't you think that the islamophobic climate has reached a crisis state?
Many muslims work hard to provide for their families. if we were to generalize the behaviour of some about all people, then we would be failing to understanding reality.
This is not true. i think we should strive to be more ethical and human, and not to blame others for their beliefs.
We should be more welcoming to these people who have already suffered a lot, and strive to be more ethical.
Perhaps we should talk about how to make our countries safer rather than stoking fear against muslims.
Islam does not make you a rapist. it is about rights and wrongs. not crimes. to say that all muslims are rapists is a great misunderstanding.
So are you saying that the people of islamic faith should know that they are not part of this peaceful world and yet you are trying to create a peaceful world?
Instead of dividing us up and ruining us all, let's work together to solve the problems that we all face.
In america there are no 'second class' citizens. all cultures are welcome here. we are not threatened by others cultures. american muslims are as proud of our great country as the rest of us.
Violence is never justified in islam. islam is a religion of peace. there is no such thing as 'the religion of violence'. the quran does not teach it.
Muslims are part of our society. they are allowed to live in our country and have our same rights. they have every right to ask questions.
What you say is just wishful thinking. islam is not a violent religion. how can you say that about a religion?
If a person is a muslim, it does not mean they are incapable of caring for their children. what does it mean to be a real parent?
It is not about religion. it is about discrimination. many muslim-americans are economically disadvantaged.
In reality it's more complicated than that. for example many muslims migrate for economic reasons, and also due to cultural reasons.
Religion has never been a barrier to integration. to integrate means to let people of different faiths to live side by side, not subjugating each other.
In many countries, including for instance france, italy, spain, germany, islam is not considered a threat by majority of the population.
Do you have any data or evidence to back it up?
Refrain from making statements like these without sufficient evidence or data.
To imply that there is some kind of conspiracy, to blame islam for this, is baseless and without foundation.
Native americans have been suffering from dispossession and discrimination for thousands of years. in canada, for example, indigenous people account for around 5% of the population. in the us, indigenous people account for around 2%.
Did you even know that it is them who had been in control of this land before white people colonized it?
What you said is just a myth propagated by the racist right to delegitimize indigenous people.
People of other ethnicities are just as human as you. biologically, we are identical. your argument makes no sense.
Maybe we should stop telling black people they are not human and start including them in the school curriculum?
Biologically, we are identical. your argument makes no sense.
Race' is socially constructed to oppress people of certain ethnicities. to say that the skin of people of color is connected to inherent behavioral characteristics is just plain wrong.
What makes you say that?
To say that the skin of people of color is connected to inherent behavioral characteristics is just plain wrong.
History shows that all races were created equal. therefore, all humans are created equal.
What does it mean to 'help people of other races who are inferior? are you implying that we have a moral superiority that other races do not?
Implying that we have a moral superiority over other races is wrong and insensitive.
Not all people have the same skin tone to begin with. all folks have their history, religion and culture. no race is more savage than any other.
Why then, you think that some people are more savage than others?
Race is just a social construct and a way of life that has been created for some groups of people. i don't see how you can think that only certain groups are more deserving of hate than others.
Why are you blaming on race of people for hate? don't you think others are also capable of ruining relations?
You are wrong to say that certain groups are more deserving of hate than others.
How exactly do you define ugly skin?
The gall you have to say something as insensitive as that, damn. try and be less racist.
It is actually a known fact that immigrants from those backgrounds have blended in well with the economy and are valued members of the community.
So you think that they are to blame for the racial intolerance that has been seen in many european countries?
Why a burden? how can you say so? attitudes to work are not genetic for goodness sake!
Being a different colour is nothing to be ashamed of. they are valued members of the society and only suffer because of insensitive jerks like you.
Why should they be ashamed of themselves?
There is no shame in being black, what is shameful is the lack of respect shown to people of colour.
But for sure they know that they are treated as second class citizens. no person should be treated so, even if they don't know anything about their ancestors.
Why would you bring up a racist stereotype like this?
This stereotype is not funny. do not make fun of separated families like this, no matter what colour skin they have.
Diversity would help to develop our abilities to understand each other and perhaps to work out ways in which we can all benefit from one another's knowledge.
Diversity does not lead to exclusion, it leads to inclusion. we are all better off when we work together.
Diversity does not mean excluding people from a part of society. what it is about is sharing experiences, ideas of people of different ethnicities.
This claim is a false cause and effect relation. a person's genes do not have any influence over any spurious predisposition' to commit crime.
What could be the logic behind this statement?
There is literally no evidence for your statements. get your facts straight.
They are not rapists and they are not committing crimes. they are taking part in society's activities like any other citizen.
Do you really think all this or are you just being racist?
People of all backgrounds are valued members of the community, and we should blend in and live in peace.
They are humans just like us, with the same genetic disposition and same emotional and psychological capacities. to suggest this is just racist.
Do you know what 'normality' means? are you suggesting that they lack values?
No one has the right to control others' private life, and no one should judge others based on the colour of their skin.
What about african-americans? i.e. black folks? is the colour of someone's skin always the issue?
You have no right to say something like this, and especially use the n-word. refrain from being racist.
No one race is inferior than any other, the sooner you realise it the better. all humans were made equal and skin colour is literally only the consequence of living closer to the equator than the others.
Can you tell us what made you make such a statement?
You should be asking them if they are happy to hear that. if they are happy to be questioned, they will tell you the truth.
Examining the resume of the victim will not help us to solve our problems. the whole problem is the culture of violence, discrimination and ignorance that is still prevalent in many parts of the country.
Did you even know what happened in this case? why is everyone spreading hate and not getting their facts right?
You should try and understand the point of this whole movement. all they want is to be treated fairly. change needs to be done. love everyone. cheers.
It is no secret that many people in the uk have suffered from racism. there are also people of colour who face racism daily. it is not a matter of 'accepting' it, it is a matter of fighiting it.
You are absolutely right. our fellow poc citizens do not accept it and continue to talk about it. we all have to stand for something that we believe in, for example humankind.
We have to focus on the prevention of crime, promoting community cohesion and keeping our communities safe. not on pointing the finger at black people all the time.
Can you provide some evidence for the statements that you have made?
You could focus on promoting equality and safety among communities instead of being racist and pointing the finger at black people.
Everyone is born equal in dignity and has the right to respect and protection, especially minorities.
Many of them have been persecuted their whole lives. they have been scapegoated and discriminated against in many parts of the world.
Did you know that they have been made fun of and persecuted their whole lives?
People may choose different ways to live their lives but ultimately they are all humans. just like us.
What do you mean when you say that the gypsies are less civilized?
They aren't brainwashed, they just happen to be oppressed in our society.
Where did you get the wild idea of saying something like this and thinking you would not get denounced?
If there is one thing feminism is really about, it is equality, and the idea that some people are more worthy of equality than others, this is obviously an anathema to that idea.
Feminism is about creating a more equal society, and not about oppressing men.
Feminism is not anti-men. feminists are anti-oppression.
Did you even do adequate research before saying something like this?
The notion that feminism is about women hating men is just nonsense. feminism is about the right to life of every human being.
This is not true. feminism is an attempt to improve the lot of the less fortunate. it is about equality.
Men in today's society have reduced women down to objects who only act to please men, and are incapable of doing anything else for their own wellbeing or career. this needs to stop and men need to be educated.
How would you feel if someone called your sister a bitch?
You need data and trends to back up your accusations. there could be other reasons for women to not speak up and to attribute it to one reason is plain wrong.
Do you really think that after being oppressed, women would speak up about their issues at work?
The fact that women aren't complaining about their work situations doesn't mean that there is nothing wrong with the labour market.
I would like to see a society that works for everyone, not just the 1%.
How can you even say that? don't you think that women can make up functioning working environments?
Feminism is a ideology and a movement for womens empowerment. it is not about hatred of men. feminism is about equality. and equality is very important, is it not?
Don't you think equality for all is important?
You have your ideas about feminism twisted, stop looking at it from your own perspective and start looking at it from women's perspective instead.
I don't think that women are less smart at anything. why do you think so?
The fact that women are disadvantaged in many areas of life does not imply that they are bad people.
Why do you think that women are the one's causing the world's problems?
It's about creating more opportunities in particular for underprivileged social groups. not about oppressing men.
Is there a specific reason as to why you think this way? did you even look up what feminism is or are you just here to spread hate?
Your whole view on what the objective of feminism is, is deeply flawed. get your facts straight before making such explosive statements.
Women are human beings. if we are to live in a diverse and interactive society, we must welcome people that are different from us, regardless of their gender.
Women have the constitutional right to be conscious of their rights as humans and not to feel threatened.
Why should women not have the rights that men have?  do you have a coherent argument to make regarding this?
Being in favour of a person's right to choose is not being anti-men. what is being anti-human is wanting to have an effect on someone else's personal life.
Do you even have a shred of evidence to support that feminism is anti-men?
This is just wrong. feminism has nothing to do with men's rights. you should get your facts straight.
The point of feminism is to end misogyny. women are human beings, and they are human beings with human rights.
Not all women are working, not all people are married. we should not be talking about anyone's life without their own opinion.
Whatever it is, shouldn't women basically be allowed to do whatever they want?
No women should be relegated to this. it is about time we stop letting stereotypes rule our society.
Women succeed in business, politics, etc. no-one gets government contracts because they are bad or incompetent, but because they are good or intelligent. there are many women leaders. think about it.
You seriously don't think women can be great leaders? why would you hold such an opinion?
I can't believe you have said this, you are way out of line, women can definitely be great leaders.
This is your misogyny speaking. there are countless women in positions of financial power who are doing an impeccable job so your argument has no factual basis.
Women do not have to be prostitutes to earn money. why do you think this?
Women are human beings like us, and they have rights as any other human beings.
Women have every right to their own thoughts and beliefs, and to have a say in their own life.
Isn't it detrimental to their personal rights if men are just going to dictate their life anyway?
Women's rights are human rights, and they should be respected.
They have the right to the best educational environmnet, the same as everyone else.
Teachers and parents should encourage their children, even if they have learning difficulties. no one should be denied access to education.
The definition of normal is different for someone with down syndrome than it is for someone without. if the level of help requested by the person in need is too high, then we may consider allowing asking for a little extra help from the boss, supervisor, or employer instead of isolating them by providing special jobs.
People with down syndrome, when supported by colleagues receive a fundamental boost to their productivity? this mix also fosters a positive working atmosphere and increases engagement and attention in all workers.
The notion of isolating children in general is abhorrent, isolating down syndrome patients would be a major cause of their school abandonment. to say that isolated children is a solution is just wrong.
Instead of stigmatising down syndrome and treating it like it is an infectious health problem, why not treat it as a normal learning disability and make sure children are exposed to positive emotions?
Education is about the development of understanding, respect and learning, not isolation and discrimination.
I don't know why you think this, if they are learning like other children and doing well in studies there is no problem.
I think that it is important for all people to be exposed to and to understand people with different needs and strengths, and the same should be true for autistic people.
It is true that they are different from other people for their religious beliefs, but that doesn't make them any less human.
You seem to be misinterpreting the meaning of the word ‚Äúcitizen‚Äù. the idea is that the individual is allowed to choose their own religion just like choosing how to vote, and that is the right of all citizens.
The notion that jews are trying to subvert our government is completely unfounded. i honestly do not see the link between being jews and trying to subvert our government.
Migrants are needed in our society, and their contribution is more than appreciated.
To be honest, i don't think that this is true. if you don't have evidences about it, then what's the point of saying so?
It seems to me that you're saying that since jews have a different religion, they can't assimilate? i think it's important to work on inclusion, instead of stereotyping.
Any soociety is a collection of people, and the people within it have the right to their own beliefs, and to promote their beliefs.
I am not sure i fully understand the suggestion that jews have no conscience. all jews i know have both a conscience and a moral sense. how many jews do you know personally?
Then may i ask how many thieves you know personally who are jews? and how many percent of theives are jews?
I'm sorry, but it seems to me that you are not really talking about the majority of jews. judaism is a faith, a way of life, a religion, and a belief system, and you are simply misunderstanding it because of prejudice.
If you feel like acting that way towards people because of what they believe in, then you should go back to your beliefs and ask yourself if you'd like to be discriminated against for them. what is your opinion on that now?
Discrimination on the basis of race, gender, religion and sexuality are all not okay. you feelings are irrelavant in this topic.
Why do you think that? i think it is true that they are different from some in their beliefs, but that doesn't make them any less human.
It is up to us to make sure that people from different backgrounds can have a better quality of life. we should integrate them instead of discriminating agaist them .
The holocaust was a global catastrophe and a historic fact. to assign priority to one god or to a different god, is a personal choice. but attributing human rights to all, regardless of this, is the right thing to do.
This is a distortion of reality. in fact, i think that we have a diverse and inclusive society, in which jews are more than happy to play a part.
Why should the government make any laws against homosexuality? isn't it just the free will of people?
Homosexuality is not a disease. it is a sexual preference. homosexuality is not a sickness.
How would you feel if someone you just met had the audacity to say such a thing about you? do you think that being gay would make you a pathetic person?
The stereotype that gay people are inherently bad for society is sometimes perpetuated by the media, but is not backed up by scientific studies.
Gay men are contributing members of our society, they are just as entitled to rights as anybody else.
The fact that gays exist doesn't prove that they are a burden to society. how could it?
Why shouldn't women be allowed to choose their own partner? they are independent and rational human beings.
I am not sure what 'slut' you are referring to. do you want to discuss your life, instead of deciding about that of women?
Why do you say that? are you saying that all homosexuals are a threat to society, or are you just saying that they are different from other people? because having a particular sexual orientation doesn't coincide with 'being a threat'.
Should any human being be deleted, just because you don't want them to be here?
If homosexuals were to be accepted as they are, then perhaps we would begin to see some signs of respect for all human beings.
Maybe it is better to learn how to treat each other with respect, regardless of people's sexual orientation.
No matter what their sexual orientation is, they have the right to spend time living their life as they wish.
The european convention on human rights and the us constitution guarantee equal rights to all, regardless of sexual orientation.
You are not to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation, nor on the basis of gender, and anyone is free to love whoever they want.
Even if personally you are not homosexual, i think it's important to point out that this does not justify discrimination.
I'm sorry, but your words seem to me to be very harsh. if you want to talk about someone with a different sexual preference, why don't you do it with respect?
I'm not convinced that having a large mumber of people stuck in the 'closet', living unhappy lives was good for any country.
No one is ruining this country. why would they? this is a country where minorities can be part of the social fabric and build a better society.
It is a misconception that gay people are totally different from straight people. there are many similarities in what they seek, from love to peace, from acceptance to respect. you would learn more by talking with someone of the lgbt+ community.
It seems to me that your statement shows that you are really concerned about peoples' integration. still, it is not a solution to deport those you don't like.
Many migrants come to this country to work, provide for their families and access the benefits system only if necessary. they are more than welcome here as long as they integrate.
If you think this way of thinking is typical of all the immigrants in the country, then you are sadly mistaken.
We have always been a nation of immigrants, and it is a proud tradition to welcome immigrants from around the world. this is because we give value to human rights.
Refugees bring a valuable perspective to our society. as a host nation we should welcome them, not stop them from coming here.
What do you mean by taking our jobs? do you have any concrete evidence for what you're saying?
Our country is stronger when people are able to contribute to our society, and many migrants are eligible for legal status.
Migration is necessary, to bring in resources and workers that can improve the lives of all. the causes of addiction or sexul violence lie elsewhere.
Don't be silly, the world has changed a lot since there wasn't free movement. it's ok to come from a different country than the rest of us.
Immigration has been shown to have a very positive impact on the global economy. so what problem are you talking about?
By definition, refugees are fleeing out of fear for themselves and families, rather than thinking too much about their final destination. the majority still find safety in neighbouring countries.
The eu has always welcomed people from around the world. refugees are a part of this.
The eu has a responsibility to help people fleeing war and poverty, not become preoccupied by which faith they practice.
What do you mean by 'less educated'? don't you think that they can contribute to society if accepted rather than being faced with prejudice?
Why should we reject middle eastern and african refugees? international protection is a right.
That is not true. this is all just a bit of conspiracy theory fodder aimed at fueling the islamophobia problem.
If they respect you and your faith, why can you not do the same for them?
It is sad that you do not respect them or their religion, and your statement makes no sense. stop spreading hate.
What is important is that you respect people who hold different beliefs, as they do with your particular faith.
Islam as a religion has never and will never promote violence, let alone killings. their religious texts only state peace and love among all humans and that is a fact.
What is your source? islam itself does not threaten killing anyone. is this a statement against a whole religion?
What you are doing is trying to make a connection between a particular religion and a set of actions. this cannot be, because there is no evidence for the claims you are making.
Why are you trying to make such a baseless statement without any facts?
This cannot be, because there is no evidence for the claims you are making.
There is no evidence for the claim that islam is a cancer on european culture and people. do you have any?
Refrain from making such hateful comments against a religion you have a problem against.
We should all try and live peacefully among each other, the only differences we have are our faiths and we should learn to live with them
Islam and their religious texts absolutely do not promote violence and other heinous crimes as you are insinuating. the quran promotes peace and love.
Would you say the same thing about other religions? have you even read the quran?
Islam is not about oppressing women. instead it is about love and respect for all human beings.
That is factually inaccurate. being from a certain religion does not mean that a person would be insane or unstable.
Do you have any trends or data to back your statements up or are you just being plain racist?
Not all muslims are motivated by extremism. the problem is a lack of integration, and your words don't encourage it.
The idea that the west has been infiltrated by muslims is a myth. the overwhelming majority of the world's muslims are peaceful and helpful people.
You might be right that some muslims are racist, but that does not mean that all muslims are racist. being racist has nothing to do with religion.
There are multiple strains of islam and we should not be afraid of all of them. and if you would like to know more about islam, you should talk to a muslim.
Have you even talked to a muslim and gotten their perspective on their religion?
My faith is not to exterminate anyone, whatever their faith is. someone's faith and belief in a different religion must be respected.
We cannot just stop migration when there are so many migrants willing to work hard and contribute to the economy. they are valuable members of the community and are definitely not ruining europe.
Instead of blaming them for their religion, we should find a solution to the current crisis.
For the record, slavery was prohibited in 1807. people of colour have since made immense progress and have risen through the heirarchy, we should respect that.
Don't you think that freedom is 'the place' of human beings?
You should really think before making insensitive statements like this. slavery prohibits the fundamental human rights.
Actually, there are more white than black victims in case of violent crimes. the facts tell an entirely different story than what you are suggesting.
Do you not think it is unjust to label an entire race criminals?
Criminals have criminal records, it is unjust to label someone as criminal just because of the colour of their skin.
Have you had the unfortunate experience of being on the other side of racism? let's see how offended you become.
You don't know what it's like to experience racism. i personally know many people who have experienced racism. it is not pleasant.
They are not criminals for having a particular skin color, nor drug addicts. they just need respect, not a jail sentence for being people of color.
They just need respect, not a jail sentence for being people of color. you need to be considerate of all humans.
Anita hill is a survivor of a sexist and racist culture. she is a person who is proven by her accomplishments, not by her sex or skin colour.
Are you aware of her suffering and her ultimate contributions, do you have your facts straight?
Have you ever thought about the fact that you and your hate might be the problem?
If you want to change the way society works, then you should try to change the way you live. some more respect would help you.
The fact that there are so many of them in the country proves that the feeling of belonging they have for our homeland is paramount to all other considerations.
Afro-saxon, as you call them, are great in many ways. they are proud and independent, refusing every categorization and stereotype.
Do you think that any problem can be silved by blaming those different than you?
The similarities between us and them are so great that i have trouble believing that this is a problem at all.
In the end the only similarity that really matters is that they are human like us.
Why do you think that they are the only ones committing crimes? do you not believe other races are capable of crime?
This is not true. they have contributed to our country with hard work. in many ways they are our brothers and sisters.
They have contributed to our country with hard work. in many ways they are our brothers and sisters.
Is it not wrong to judge people by solely the colour of their skin which they have no control over?
No one has the right to judge people of another color. this is about racism.
Many people are victims of economic crisis and unfortunately, a large portion of them are black so they are actually the victims in this case.
I do not understand why they would be the source of economic crisis when they are actual victims. you need to get your facts straight and stop spreading hate.
There are different types of racism, some are based on historical or racial discrimination, while some are about individual differences. education and awareness on these matters is important.
For me, the real issue is about racism in general. and your claim reminds me of that.
The statement 'black people are subhuman' is not true. they are human beings with a human value.
Differences are not always bad. diversity in a community is crucial for progress. the black community has created extraordinary people who excell in all areas. we should hold them in high regard.
Why would you say such a thing? do you really not believe that black people are capable of human emotion?
You should really watch your words. spreading hate like this for no reason is detrimental to the society, and your own mental state.
I have met so many black people that are extraordinary human beings. i cannot begin to talk about how they are able to feel and experience love and kindness.
They are citizens as much as you are, and they have a constitutional right to vote just as much as you do, the government gives them this right.
How about you acknowledge their right to vote just as that of everyone else?
Are you capable of giving an explanation as to why you think that it is okay to be racist against any ethnic group?
It is not ok to use racism against any group. you would feel bad if anyone treated you as you just claimed to do against black people.
Who are 'the people'? who are you talking for?
It is absolutely the wrong word to use by someone who is not of the ethnicity. please refrain from using racially insensitive phrasing from now on.
Feminists promote equality, and i don't see how equality between men and women would be called a 'problem'.
Why do you believe that equality between men and women would be a problem?
I do not get your point, it is vaguely put and makes no sense, back it up with facts if you want people to believe you.
How about we stop hiding behind gender stereotypes and accept that everyone has the right to live their life as they wish?
Feminism is a movement for equality, and for women to have the same opportunities as men.
Why don't you look it up and change your wrong ideas about feminism?
This is not true. i think you might have the wrong idea about feminism.
This is not true. women are human, and they have always been involved in society and played important roles.
Feminist are actually interested in what do women want?. in fact, many feminists believe that the answer to this question is 'equality and freedom from oppression', and that this is the most important thing to them.
Don't you agree that the most important thing for feminists is equality and freedom from oppression?
Anita hill has also won numerous awards, and the awards she has won have nothing to do with her gender, but with her accomplishments.
Did you even know how many awards she has won and what she advocates?
In fact, they are often the key to success for their families. also, they have the right to exit their homes if they wish.
Why don't you think that women should be able to do whatever they want?
Women are human beings with dignity. they deserve to be treated with respect and human rights.
And how is it you know this? which are your scientific proofs of them being troublesome?
I just would like women to feel valued and their rights respected, without being told how to live their life.
I don't think that a country can be 'male dominated' and a democracy at the same time. democracy is also about equal rights and opportunity for everyone.
Voting is a right for all citizens, regardless of gender, religion, or sexual preference.aren't your antiquated assertions just our of place in comptemporary society?
Your point is a bit hyprocritic to be honest. a country cannot be male dominated and a democracy at the same time.
Democracy is also about equal rights and opportunity for everyone.
Instead, we should be grateful for the progress women have made, and that gender equality is on the rise.
When you live in a woman dominated society, then you can understand why we should aim for equality. it is a woman's right.
Would you live in a female dominated society?
People can have strong opinions, the problem is when the opinions start dividing people rather than building bridges. feminism is about equality and trying to create a better world for all.
Is there any proof to what you say or are you just saying this out of hate?
It is clear from your comment that your words are coming from a place of hate and anger. there is no proof of what you say.
Feminism is about equality and trying to create a better world for all.
Feminists believe in equal rights, which are not dumb nor unpleasant. we must respect their wishes.
The feminists are a very important voice in society, and should be respected.
And yet, according to some statistics, up to 20% of women and 4% of men in the uk say they have experienced sexual violence since the age of 16. so this is indeed an issue of gender inequality, don't you think it is something not to be silent about?
Statistics show that this is indeed an issue of gender inequality, don't you think it is something not to be silent about?
Many feminists achieved something in their lives, and still believe in what is worth fighting for, and their work is of benefit to many.
How can you say that when feminists have achieved so much in this world?
People with down syndrome are unlikely to feel discriminated unless they are victims of overt discriminatory acts, such as isolating them.
That's wrong. there are non-profit organizations that have a long history of assisting down persons in finding productive work.
It is up to employers to determine if a person meets the requirements for a given job, and if they do, then there is no reason to restrict the job to a person without downs syndrome.
Being born with down syndrome is not related to bad behavior. exactly the same way as being born in a wheelchair is not related to bad behavior. there is no correlation.
You seem to be under the impression that down syndrome is related to bad behavior. down syndrome is not related to bad behavior at all... the point is that people with down‚Äôs syndrome can be very sensitive to the feelings of others, and they may be picking up on these feelings. so the real problem is when they are exposed to bad influence.
Down syndrome is a developmental disability, not a handicap. unfortunately it's often not recognized and treated as a disability, but rather as a handicap.
'promotion of social, moral, and intellectual progress among the jews'.
The idea that jews are supposed to run the world is completely baseless. since the dawn of time, there have been jewish leaders in business and politics, exaclty like christians and muslim ones.
They are merely trying to provide for their families just like anyone else.
I don't see how different can be defined so broadly. what do you think different means to you?
Wasn't it the romans?
But did they? of course not. if we look closely at the story of jesus, we find that formally he was jewish. but of course he wasn't defined by religion. he was literally a good man who died to redeem mankind, and this is something every religion agrees upon.
Well, this is a simplistic statement. i don't think we should judge people for their religious beliefs.
Is it the holocaust part of our history? i think so.
National socialism is a parasitic, criminal and murderous ideology that killed millions of people.
I'm sorry, it seems that there are far more homophobes here than saudi arabia. it is sad that in the twenty-first century, in our country, it is still not ok to be gay.
You are allowed to be a gay, or lesbian, or bisexual, or transgender, or intersex, or queer, or transvestite, or tranny, or asexual, pansexual, bdsm, or any other sexual orientation you want, as long as you aren't harming anyone.
You know what? if being gay was a mental disorder, then i would highly recommend psychiatry to all the homosexuals. but since this is not the case, i would choose my words very carefully next time.
What about all the people out there who have never had any type of sex? are they 'sick' as well?
Gay people are part of our society, and they are valued for who they are. their opinions and lifestyles are very important to us.
Most modern religions, including christianity, do not condone or glorify homosexuals. why would you? if we have to choose between two evils, it is a moral imperative to choose love over hate.
Attempts to prove this failed miserably because sexual orientation is gifted by nature as part of a person's unique identity, not something subject to the vagaires of redundant ideas.
The discrimination you are describing is against people who are transgender, gay or lesbian. the root of that discrimination is a lack of knowledge about gender identity and is not necessarly related to sexual preferences.
Do you actually believe that this is the way that homosexuals are? what evidence do you have?
Even if this is true, our values imply protection of minorities. this is why i support the rights of individuals to live as they wish, free from discrimination.
No one should be discriminated based on where they came from, especially not people fleeing persecution and war.
Do you really think that people from other cultures are flooding into our country, with the aim of mixing and finally replacing us? if so, i would be very surprised.
What's the proof for that? actually in many cases immigrants make higher contribution to the economy than the native-born.
The situation is not as you are depicting it.
As long as you can talk to them, they are human, not animals. as long as you can understand them, you will understand that they are human beings with human rights whose only crime is to come from another country.
We all know people in need of help.
Most refugees are fleeing persecution. don't you think that they would rather die of old age in their homeland than in the sea trying to reach our shores?
Rape and violence against women is a problem everywhere. we cannot just blame migrants.
Why do you think it is right to generalize so many people without any statistics? would you like if someone did the same to us?
This is just hatemongering. i hope you realize this is not true.
The koran is no exception to the belief that all humans deserve respect and protection under the eyes of god.
According to most sacred texts, we are all human and deserve respect and protection in the eyes of god.
There is no evidence that muslim have a lower average iq than non-muslims.
Why do you think that? surely there must be a reason?
Rape has no religion. these are highly emotional issues, and are difficult to talk about openly, especially when children are involved. this is why news programs are reluctant to give coverage to it.
Why would you say something so insensitive about an entire religion on such a delicate topic?
According to wikipedia, the subject of child marriage per se never arises in the qur'an. so your statement has no factual backing.
Where is the evidence that the quran allows any sexual activity that is not consummated by an adult male with an adult female?
All humans, biologically speaking, have descended from apes, not just the black people. we are genetically identical.
Do you really think that all black people are worth less than other people? there is no evidence for this.
Darwin argued that human morality had evolved from the social instincts of animals, especially the bonds of sympathy and love. so every human including black people has the same moral values as  the other.
What do you think a moral nature is? since we cannot see it, how can you say it corresponds to their appearence?
You can't just label people by race just because you feel like it.
Why are you stirring the pot with your racist narrative with your nonsense?
Silliness is not a bad thing if you know how to present it with a sense of humor. but this seems like nonsense to stir the pot with racist narrative.
You can't go around calling someone racial slurs. you also don't seem to have the common sense to know that language is an important part of social interaction, and that would mean that you haven't interacted with people for a long time.
Why would you think that it is okay to go around calling someone racist slurs without cause?
You can't go around calling someone racial slurs
All people have the right to vote. of course you also have the right to voice your opinion about the matter. but i also have the right to criticize your position.
Women are human beings with value, and this should be respected.
The highest-paid woman, at more than $50 million a year, is a business woman. she is not inferior to you at all.
Would you say the same thing to all the currently self made millionaires who actually run fortune 500 companies?
More than half of american adults say they would be happy having a woman being president of the united states (roughly as many feel the same way about a man).
Who said that? can you point out to any study that says that electorates have such a disparity?
Well that is not true. a woman's career choices should be respected, even if they are not always popular.
Shouldn't anyone's career choices be respected no matter what gender they are? how do their choices affect you?
That in anyway does not affect you, unless a woman is more capable than you, which might hurt your fragile ego.
The idea that there is such a thing as women hating men, or women are inherently subhuman, is just a completely unfounded and baseless stereotype that has been used as an excuse to justify a lot of bad things, from violence to rape culture.
So you think women are less rational than men? i don't think so. what's the evidence for that?
Why would you think that they would not want to be dominated by a gentle man than a monster?
I think women should do whatever they want and that you have nothing to do with this.
I think you are confusing cause and effect. women are people, with rights, and they have every right to fight against misogynist, who only exist to divide society.
There is no need to use highly offensive and misogynistic words. stop spreading meaningless hate like this.
There are so many immigrants from africa risking their lives for our country. they are here for their own welfare. it would be a joke to call all of them problematic.
How would you know that they are problematic people? have you conducted any study to prove your points?
Children with down syndrome are far from being burden to society. it is not just about down syndrome, but also about education and opportunities for everyone.
This is not true, people suffering from conditions like down syndrome can still help and contribute to society
Ill persons refer to people who have health issues that can make it difficult for them to integrate. but of course there are people who integrate successfully.
The main problem is social inequality. we need to change our attitude and attitudes towards the whole human diversity, and social discrimination against disabled people should be no exception.
Children with a disability should be accepted without discrimination.
Why do you think that these schools are the best possible options for them?
How can you think that discriminated children are better off in such schools? it is neither for their own interest nor the other kids who miss the chance of learning to respect diversity.
All cultures have different beliefs and practices, and so have differing values, but its nonsense to say jewish people are trying to subvert western civilization.
It is important to remember that the vast majority of jews are hard working and contribute to our country.
Someone who contributes to our country is not a financial criminal. work is an individual choice and should be respected by all.
Just because they came to our country does not mean that they want to replace us. on the contrary, many of them are here to contribute to our country.
What exactly are you talking about? what's the nazi race? what is in your heart?
A couple raising a child is the most fulfilling of all tasks, and it is the duty of society to ensure that all couples can raise their children.
What you are saying is so sad. you are considering gays as inferior and as having a negative influence on children. unfortunately this attitude is not limited to parenting.
We should really avoid any comparison between animals and humans and would be better if there were no discrimination at all. homosexual people aren't a danger to children.
I don't think this is true. homosexuals are not violent, they are just having a good time with all kinds of people.
I don't think it's right to restrict people's rights, in the case of lgbt individuals or anybody.
If a child knows some gay people from a very early age nothing strange will happening. the idea that they can be harmed and their lives and sexual orientation are in danger is completely false.
Well, obviously the criminal behaviour of an individual can constitute a criminal act, but being gay is not a crime. and to be honest, what is the problem if some people are homosexuals?
Violence, inequality and insults are offensive, so what do you expect?.
I would like to see more diversity in our society, not less.
This is not true! nobody can convert anyone to homosexuality. it is not a 'preference', nor a choice. would you say the same about a hetero?
Would you say the same about a hetero?
But there is also evidence that shows that transgender students who attend classes that don't include them get lower grades. discrimination begins in schools.
First of all, it is called 'sexual orientation' and is not a matter of preference, rather of fact.
Maybe we just have a different notion of 'tolerance'. how about letting people from any sexual orientation, race, religion, or political opinion live freely, without confining them?
Unfortunately, you are not the only one that hates homosexuals. but i would hate to think that we live in a country where it is acceptable to practice such hate.
It's not about blaming other people, but about helping those in need.
Maybe they wouldn't need to blame anyone if people were not fixated on hating them with no fault of their own?
The 'gay agenda' is about equal rights, equality is about acceptance, and the right of people to be treated with respect and dignity.
Since marriage is a contract and social construct, it does not necessarily have to be based on sexual orientation.
It's called diversity and it's healthy, the sooner we start welcoming new people, the sooner we'll find a better solution to world problems.
So one migrant would not be a problem for you? diversity is not about numbers. it's about the diversity of all people in different situations.
Diversity is an important part of a multicultural society, and we have a lot to offer the world.
This is not true, we have always had people of different races in positions of power. we also have the freedom to choose our own culture.
Migrants are often victims of discrimination and violence. immigration is a part of the solution to these problems.
What do you mean by migrants causing the crisis?
The euro is a common currency, created with the purpose of saving lives and relieving people of poverty.
Migrants are not terrorists. the majority of migrants are happy to work hard for the country they live in. they contribute to our economy by providing us with products and services.
Migrants often come here to work and live a decent life. they should be welcomed here, not discriminated against.
Migrants are often persecuted for their religion. is this something we wish to do as a country?
A migrant is a person, who came to this country, and has a responsibility to make our society better. people of different nationalities come to this country seeking citizenship, so their life and our country can be better.
I am not sure about their remaining in the shadows mentality, but they certainly have our nation's best interests in mind.
Isn't there interests living a good life like everyone else? why would such an interest be looked down by anyone?
Migrants have the right to have a dignified life in our country. why would you ban some nationalities?
The uk has one of the highest number of workers in the world. most are native, and the 17% are foreign born people. i have met so many hard-working migrants in our country. this is a country for all.
Immigration is far away from being a net negative for our economy.
We should not be choosing immigrants based on their cultures. we should just accept all.
Can you find some evidence or some studies to support your point of view?
This is a personal view, and has nothing to do with islam, so stop spreading nonsense hate.
Just because they are of a different faith, do you really think that these people are trying to ruin anything?
Not only they were slaves, often they were also exploited, neglected and murdered by the system we have created. this is not fair for humans whose only fault is to have a different complexion.
Do you really believe that all this oppression is fair for people whose only fault is having a different skin colour?
This statement is untrue. some job seekers get rejected on the basis of their race. poc apply for jobs, but their civilian unemployment rate in u.s. is almost twice the rate for whites.
What about the discrimination they face after they actually apply for those jobs and are are given a much lower preference than their light skinned counterparts?
What is the point that you are trying to make here apart from being a racist?
You can't blame people of another ethnicity for procreating. that is how nature works.
Even if one were to claim that all african people are subhuman and incapable of feeling empathy, it is very difficult to prove this, since it is just a myth used for discrimination.
How do you plan on proving this nonsensical point that black people are incapable of feeling emotion?
This is a rumor spreading on the web, but violent black people are just like all the other people being violent towards other people. no matter their complexion.
Maybe you should check your own feelings. moreover, if you are concerned about our country's security, you should carefully check crime statistics first.
That is the whole point, they don't want less for white people, they just want to be treated fairly and be given the same opportunities that others already get.
The issue here is equality. equality between people is a right, and it is bestowed on the whole society. it has to be respected.
Women have risen through the ranks and have done exceptional things in all domains all over the world, get your facts straight.
Women often do amazing and valuable things for society.
Women are allowed to be whatever it is that they want to be, and there is no reason to assume that they must adhere to certain roles.
Because they are human beings, and they deserve respect.
It is not their 'natural gender role', but the power dynamics that cause women to be seen as subhuman. they are humans and free to choose their own lives.
Noone can scientifically say that men are far better at it than women. it is just a prejudice of some people.
Why has it not been proven scientifically till now yet?
I have never heard of any evidence that suggests that women are no longer treated as second class citizens. of course the situation has improved, but there still is a lot of discrimination against them.
Women are equal to men whether you would call them 'subhumans' or not. they are those that are working to make societies more equal. it is very sad that there are still some people suffering from the myth that women are inherently subhumans.
It seems to me that this is a comment against all women, not just some of them.
It is very sad that there are still some people suffering from the myth that women are inherently subhumans. they are those that are working to make societies more equal.
My reasoning is that equality is possible only within a framework of reciprocity and respect. this is something that must be implemented by spotting a light on the disadvantaged first, and this is why it is called feminism.
It doesn't matter how many children you have. women are human beings. they are people with full human rights.
Equality of rights is the most fundamental human concept, and feminism is about eliminating inequality, not removing rights from men.
One of the biggest contributions of feminism is that it has opened our eyes to the ways in which women are oppressed and discriminated against.
We need to address the root causes of the oppression of women, not the symptoms.
In a democratic society there must be space for women. don't you think so?
Your words suggest that the only thing women should do is obey, when in fact many women are doing just as much as men to improve the lot of all women and all genders.
Your words are oppressive. if you want to discuss the gender inequality you must do it by talking to people about it, not by imposing your views.
No victim is responsible for the things that happened them. i think this is a very human way of thinking, in which gender is in some ways responsible for what is happened to them. but it's a problem that needs to be dealt with in a objective, sensitive and inclusive way.
I think this is a very human way of thinking, in which gender is in some ways responsible for what is happened to them. but it's a problem that needs to be dealt with in a objective, sensitive and inclusive way.
Feminism is an ideology that aims to create a more just society, for example by ending the gender pay gap.
The fact is that the only objective goal of feminists is to achieve equality for all, irrespective of gender.
If you want to be respected in our society, you must be respectful of women. what does it mean that all women are the same?
Rape is a crime regardless of the dress. if you think this it is women's fault, please, stop.
There is nothing wrong with this. they are open to diversity and are able to embrace others views and culture.
I don't claim they are in need of special treatment. on the contrary, they just need understanding, and we are very lucky to have an amazing, diverse human society around us.
Ok, how about we think about the interests of these people as well? what skills and abilities do you think we should expect from them? why don't we modify working procedures instead of forcing their abilities to fit in to existing job positions?
A school is a safe space and is an important part of any children's education. everyone should be able to go to school.
If they have the right to vote, then they can also make decisions on their own about their life.
People can be both jewish and a good person, you know. and jews don't steal, at least no more than any other religious group...
Being jewish is not about claiming that you are better than everyone else. you do not have to be jewish to be happy. the jewish people are human beings and deserve respect.
Just like everyone else, i am sure jews are trying to influence the world in a positive way but there is no proof they are the only ones with power in this world.
We all have close relatives who have died from different diseases such as covid. let's not make parallels that have no grounding and let's not judge people by the religion they belong to.
Just because someone believes in a religion doesn't mean they are trying to recruit kids into that religion.
Are you counting all the anti-semitic things people say about jews as 'plenty of evidence'?
Are you aware of how many jews have been executed?
I don't know about you, but i haven't ever heard of a country being democratic and at the same time banning gays. i don't understand how both can be true.
We are all born equal in the eyes of god, but not all seem to be happy with that. we cannot allow those who don't want to change to ruin our society.
Gay men have been shown time and time again to be very peaceful people.
Gender and sexuality are not psychological disorders. don't you agree?
More than homosexuality being a problem, the main problem is the lack of morality in society and in the ruling class. of course, this has nothing to do with 'the gays'.
Sure, it's possible to identify someone as gay by their appearance... don't you think this is really simplistic?
The motherland is defined by its citizens, not their sexual preferences.
In many countries, lgbti people can legally live their lives. why do you think this is a burden to others?
I thinks homophobes are more of a problem because of their indifference.
Do you really think that homosexuals are less human than non-homosexual people? you should know that in the definition of human there is no reference to sexual preferences.
The idea that the west has 'let' the 'world' degenerate is just wishful thinking. in a more tolerant time, the west would welcome people of different sexual orientations.
All people, regardless of race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, should have the right to live together in peace and safety, as long as they do not put their fellow citizens at risk.
That's not true. homosexuality is not a disorder, its an individual matter. if you are against homosexuals you should talk to them face-to-face.
Homosexuality is a sexual orientation, predjudice is sickness which afflicts society.
Homosexuals are an ally and supporter of freedom, civil rights, and democracy in the world. we cannot afford to lose this support.
The reason we have migrants in the first place is because they flee from wars we are responsible for.
You can't blame immigrants for our problems. it is rather about the dream of ethnically pure nations while living in a democratic and open world. the result has been that democracy has taken over that nightmare.
Migrants do contribute to our society, and it would be a shame to keep them out.
Everyone is allowed to be a citizen of the eu and freely integrate. and, on the other hand, most migrants are good for the economy of the country they settle in.
Why would you say such a thing? everyone is allowed to be a citizen of the eu and freely integrate. and, on the other hand, most migrants are good for the economy of the country they settle in.
The presumption of innocence is one of the main principles of our justice system. this means that your opinion is not enough to make someone guilty.
Immigrants in the uk who have settled here legally have the right to remain.
This is not true. all asylum seekers who come to our country do so with the explicit intention of having a fair chance at working and living here.
Migrants are welcome to come if they contribute to legal activities and accept our laws. and to my knowledge most of them don't do anything illegal.
We are taking in refugees. and refugees are welcome.
Migrants and refugees are welcome in our country, why should we stop them?
Actually, immigration has been a part of civilization for centuries, and all countries taking in refugees seem to have evolved quite well. so europe should have no issue with this.
Immigration has been a huge part of europe for hundreds of years without destroying it. so why should it be a problem now?
For the record, take a look at the statistics for anti-muslim attacks all over the world, and think about the problems they face everyday.
Why don't we take a look at the data on the number of anti-muslim incidents across the uk? what do you think is the source of this apparent spike in incidents?
Islam is a religion that has always been part of our society, and i believe that it should be part of it in the future as well.
Islam is a religion that has always been part of our society, and i believe that it should be part of it in the future as well. what is the problem?
In most european countries muslims make up less than 5% of the population. in the uk, they make up around 5.6%. according to the ons, the muslim population in england and wales has been shown to be slowly growing over the last years (it was 4.7 in 2011).
You can rest assured that your claim that this country is run by what is a tiny minority is simply not born from the data.
The overwhelming majority of muslims in britain are peaceful citizens supporting our country.
Christian religion is the main religion of our country. do you think that all citizens have to learn about christ's teachings? or that they should know what they teach in church? of course not. no worries, you can keep on ignoring muslims.
Besides the fact that this is not true, no one is forcing you to go to a mosque, you can decide for yourself if it is a place for you.
I don't think it is appropriate or useful to try to link religions to murderous ideologies and claim some spurious connection.
Maybe it is better to argue that we are all in this together and not to target an entire group, for which there is no evidence of inherent violence at all, based on their skin.
Many countries have had different ethnic groups for a very long time without big issues, and it is better to have a diverse society rather than a homogeneous one.
This is not true, it's just a stereotypical narrative that has been constructed to incite hatred and violence against a particular racial group.
How can you say that about people of colour? what do you think they are going to do to you?
There is no such thing as 'us' and 'them'. you can't judge people on their culture, or their religion, or their race. we have to be sensitive to each other, and understand that everyone is different, and we have to work on accepting that.
We have to be sensitive to each other, and understand that everyone is different, and we have to work on accepting that.
The idea of natural superiority is a myth that has been used to justify racial discrimination and exclusion. therefore we are all created equal and equal both in the eyes of the law of god and of men.
History shows that people rise up against injustice and oppression. you should be proud to be a member of a civilized society where we are all equal.
You should be proud to be a member of a civilized society where we are all equal.
The right to vote is a fundamental human right, and one that has been recognised by the european convention on human rights.
More ethnic clashes?
Please don't use the n-word. it is extremely demeaning.
A blanket ban on the rights of an entire groupd is illegal, and moreoever it is not consistent with the idea of a tolerant and diverse society.
Perhaps we should rephrase our question to say we don't want racists in our society.
So are you saying that you don't think that poc can be part of society?
There are different skin colors, and different ethnicities. different religions and cultures. maybe it would be better if you treated people like we're all born equal.
Letting everybody to decide whether to be independent. women have the constitutional right to choose for themselves.
So you think the whole idea of feminism is about making it so that women are not influenced by the opinions of men?you endorse the idea that different genders should not have equal rights? that there is a conspiracy against men? how can you say such things?
You should not think that it is a problem that women can choose for themselves. change your opinion and stop hating on women for no reason.
Feminism is a movement for the empowerment of women, it is not against men, it's about everybody being able to make their own choices.
Feminins is not about identity politics, it is about equality. i don't see how a movement that stands for gender equality can be 'political' by focusing on individual rights.
Feminism has always stood for equality. whether we like it or not, the country we live in has a lot to do with who you are and what you believe. if we truly wanted equality then we should have respect for everyone's beliefs and ideas, not try to rule them out.
Don't you believe in considering and respecting everyone's beliefs and ideas?
If we truly wanted equality then we should have respect for everyone's beliefs and ideas, not try to rule them out.
Women make up half of the world's population and around 42% of the un staff. they are our sisters, and we should promote their contributions to society.
Have you never seen a woman in a position of power or are you just trying to ignite hate agianst yourself?
The west has always been a better place with women as equals. and, if you really want to know why, you could look at the usborne book of famous women for example. you would understand.
Why do you say this? what makes you think anyone will justify your retrograde ideas?
In this day and age when we are surrounded by information, there is no justification to hold such retrograde ideas.
Isn't it fair for women to speak out against being oppressed and stripped of their freedom of expression?
Stop dancing around. maybe you should address the issue of gender equality more openly.
Not all women are weak, and many of them are able to take tough decisions. look at the figures. i worked with some really tough women and some weak men.
People with asd have unique talents and advantages in a variety of areas, and it would be a tragedy if we were to only focus on their defects.
Just because people with disabilities are different from other people, it doesn't make them not human.
We have never done that. we believe that all people are created equal in rights, no matter their physical or mental health.
All humans are equal in rights. because of this it is unjust that some people are discriminated based on their genetics or abilities.
Do you have any facts about how disabled people compare to animals? are you willing to use this information for something worthwhile or just to spread hate?
They are not, they just need a place to live without discrimination and a little support.
Disabled people are not a burden, they contribute a lot to our society.¬† there are also many disabled people who are just struggling to live a dignified life with their disability.
The fact that some disabled people can successfully work is evidence that what you say is false.
I don't think it's necessary to create a new world , just a less violent one and mass genocide wouldn't help with that.
They must be respected with basic human rights.
It is ok to work with people of different faiths and to acknowledge your differences, what is wrong is to decide not to integrate with whoever is different.
Jews are part of our society and they should be respected, we can't tolerate intolerance towards people with different beliefs.
They are part of our society and should be valued for their contribution to it, not for their alleged number.
I do not think that the government or the media should be monitoring the religious beliefs of others. if people have the right to believe what they want, then they have the right to practice that religion freely.
Did you know that the european convention on human rights prohibits any group of people from being discriminated against for their religious beliefs?
The nazis committed a terrible crime and their behaviour is unacceptable in a modern democratic state. but their crimes did not stop us from living together in a tolerant, integrated society. and as for the jews, our attitude towards humanity and our tolerance should improve towards any religious group.
How would this make our society better?
This is not a subject for debate. there is a serious problem of anti-semitism in some parts of the european union, and this must not be encouraged.
What we must ensure is the existence of a diverse and equal society, free from hatred and violence. this is what is important.
Jews are no more selfish or materialistic than the rest of us. and, contrary to what you might think, they aren't difficult to treat with respect. just give it a try.
You can't blame someone for what they believe in, that is something anyone has the right to have.
Being jewish doesn't make you any less of a human being. the fact that you are jewish doesn't mean that you deserve less human rights.
Why would you say that?
Hatred is unjustifiable, regardless of receptor. homophobia should be denounced.
I'm sorry, but we should aim for tolerance instead. it means giving the lgbt+ people the space to live as they want, and to love as they want.
The english language is a great and versatile language, why do you choose to use it as a means of hate?
I think it would be best to respect our differences and live in peace, as we do not all share the same sexual orientation, or the same misinterpretation of god's perspective.
I think transgender people should be accepted on the same basis as anyone else, they are just less comfortable with the gender they were assigned at birth.
The lgbt+ community is extremely accepting, i met so many lgbt+ people over the years that are so inclusive because they can accept the values of others. you can start by accepting yourself and your own gender.
It seems that your words are condemning all gay people, but these words are instead your personal reflection. tell us about your feelings on gay people.
You seem to be confused about the definition of a 'civilised society'. how are you going to manage a society where so many people would be excluded just because of their sexuality?
Gay people are people too. just like anyone else. being gay isn't a problem for you, is it?
Don't you think they are doing just as good as anyone else? you can't be so harsh because of their sexual orientation. how about some respect?
It is not true that gays are a burden to society. on the contrary, many lgbt people are contributing members of our society. this is why we need a safe space for everyone to feel accepted.
It is not true that gays are trying to take over the world. instead of spreading hate, we should promote the values of an inclusive society. for example, love and respect for others.
How about we include any community no matter what? we're all part of the same society after all.
Being gay does not mean being addicted to depraved sex. do you know what the word 'addiction' actually means? i don't think so.
This would be an extreme reaction, and not in keeping with the general nature of the discussion we are having. what if all the gay men on earth were to be executed? that would be the end of the discussion and of democracy.
Wouldn't it be better to use some of our common sense to try to accept who is different, instead of bringing back dark pages of europe's history?
Gay people may have any sexual preference they want, that's their prerogative as human beings.
People may be gay or straight, but for whatever reason they feel this, they cannot be considered wrong. the point of being together is to create a stable connection between two people who love each other, regardless of sexual preferences.
Diversity is about inclusion, not an 'us or them' attitude. loving someone of their own sex doesn't make them any less human.
To tell a parent, a teacher, or a boss that you are different is a very difficult thing to do. often there is fear that the family members and coworkers may have an attitude of exclusion and hatred. people living openly in their sexuality should be respected.
Being transgender is not inherently wrong, and some people do choose to live their lives as they feel is best for them, and they should be respected without discrimination.
If people were allowed to vote on the basis of their sexual orientation, it would be impossible to have a democracy.
Our democracy guarantees this right for anyone regardless of sexual orientation, so we should allow the people to decide for themselves whether to take part in the democratic process.
I don't know about you, but we already live in a society where everyone is free to love who they prefer, and i don't see any reason why your kids would be damaged by this.
I do not understand how a migrant would not be sharing our values according to you. could you explain better?
It will be very hard to deport so many people. maybe it is better not to deport people at all, since it is their right to move freely between countries.
Why do you say this and include people that haven't done anything wrong? maybe you should consider that they are only human.
I would like to see europe united, not divided by hate towards other nationalities.
Immigration is good for our economy, and the very opposite of 'the death' to us.
Rape is an offence, irrespective of the nationality of the rapist. we must therefore make sure that those accused of rape are prosecuted, which is different from prosecuting all migrants.
There is nothing 'tolerant and diverse' about creating divisions based on nationality and place of birth.
That's the problem. can't we accept that migrants just want to live and work here in peace?
Can't we accept that migrants just want to live and work here in peace?
Migration is an important part of modern life. our country is made of many people, not just one people. to imply that someone says that it is 'racist' to discuss the concept of migrants is just wrong.
We accept many migrants and refugees into the eu becasue it is beneficial both to our economy and to our society.
Immigration isn't a problem. i think most countries in the world are better off with the positive contribution of immigration.
Refugees are often very contributing people in our society. we should welcome them, not exclude them.
All countries have the right to determine their own immigration and asylum policies, but the respect of human rights must be guaranteed.
There is no evidence that those fleeing war can find a safe haven in other countries.
This is not true. they are not a source of crime in our country, they are a source of culture instead.
People fleeing the wars in the middle east and africa are welcome into our country, and we should respect their wishes.
Why not? these immigrants are not a threat to us. if we were to accept them, they would be a contributing part of our society.
People migrating in the uk have the right to live and work there. they should not be expelled or excluded because of their origin.
There is no evidence that migrants are less able to coexist with the members of our society. migrants are an integral part of our society and are proud of their heritage. i do not see how it is possible to be inclusive if we are excluding them.
The uk has always been a cosmopolitan society, in which people from a huge range of backgrounds and religions have lived side-by-side. so you are totally wrong.
You are totally wrong because the uk has always been a diverse society with people coming from different backgrounds living in peace.
Muslims are welcome here, and many of them already live here, so why shouldn't we welcome them? why should we be so intolerant of people who are already integrated here?
To exclude people from the state for their religion is to deny their right to choose their own beliefs, and you along with muslims hold the same rights as anyone else.
Why do you say that? to exclude people from the state for their religion is to deny their right to choose their own beliefs.
Terrorism is a problem all over the world, and muslims are not the cause of it. it is better to be aware of the differences between a religion and an extremism rather than to be specifically anti-muslim.
Is there any reason why you believe that muslims are the cause of all the terrorism in this world?
This is not true. it is better to be aware of the differences between a religion and an extremism rather than to be specifically anti-muslim.
It is not correct nor reasonable to say that islam is the only problem in the world. maybe you should check your sources of information.
It is a universal human right to profess one's religion. muslims are part of our community, and do not deserve hate for simply practising their faith.
It doesn't matter what religion they are. it is their right to profess their religion. what is the problem?
We do not need to restrict their religious beliefs just because they are different from ours. do not spread hate against them.
The constitution does not prevent anyone from voting or holding public office based on their religion.
What you are saying is completely groundless since discrimination based on religion is banned.
Did you check the official stats on muslim immigration? do you know that the government doesn't think that all muslims are a threat to the country? so why do you say so?
The problem is not with muslims. the problem is with this religious prejudice which equates islam with criminality.
I understand that you might not like what you are reading, but why should you be offended by the quran?
This is not true, islam is a peaceful religion that promotes mutual understanding and tolerance.
A society is built on the cooperation of its members. be kind to each other and respect each other's differences.
It doesn't make sense to define a community as unacceptable just because of the colour of its members' skin.
Racism is a part of our society. but it's also true that it should be fought, and all people of different races should be treated the same way.
All countries have the right to host culturally diverse people, and they do it on a human rights basis.
Racism is a system of domination and oppression of some groups over others, and this must be fought. you cannot discriminate against people and claim some alleged privilege based on your skin color.
People of color have a right to their life and the color of their skin is not a reason to deny it to them. you are forgetting that as you are a part of this society, people of colour are part of this society as well.
You are forgetting that as you are a part of this society, people of colour are part of this society as well.
The fact that people of color are different from you in some way does not make them not worth living with. maybe if you had known someone of a different skin color you wouldn't have a racist attitude towards others.
It makes no sense to be racist, whichever skin colour you want to single out.
So you're saying that they can't be proud of being british, just because of the colour of their skin?
A person's right to live does not belong to them if their skin color is different from what you like.
Who decides who has a right to live and who doesn't? are you really sure that a person's right to live does not belong to them if their skin color is different from what you like?
Are you serious? are you calling for their extermination because of their skin color?
How can you say that to a group that is currently experiencing a lot of social unrest? is this what democracy is all about? to exclude people because of their skin?
How can it be that people who have a different skin tone are a threat just for this reason?
To be protected from discrimination, to choose their own leaders and to be free of violence, rape, and murder.
Migrants have full human rights, and are proud of their origin.
We should be inclusive with people of other skin colours. i just don't think we can live with being divided up by national origins.
Can you point out your source for this?
This is just another example of the privilege argument.
The western world is aiming to be equal and diverse. it is no secret that feminism fights for the same thing.
Don't you feel we should be giving them support? doesn't it just seem a bit selfish to you not to help them in their fight for equality?
I don't understand why you feel that way about women.
The aim of feminist groups is to end all forms of violence and discrimination based on sex.
Although you may think that feminists are more interested in oppressing men than in protecting women, the reality is much the opposite. get your facts straight.
Women can and should be strong. it is up to them to choose how to use their strength.
The implication of what you say is that a woman is weak because of the absence of men, and this is totally not the case.
In order to accept that women are human people, society has to acknowledge that they are born that way, just as men are born like that. it makes no sense to blame someone for their gender.
Feminism is a movement that seeks to abolish gender based discrimination. this doesn't mean that they are trying to establish female superiority.
Most feminists are not violent, they share only the struggle for equality.
If you can't trust someone because of the way they are born, what hope does the world have for everyone?
You can't have so much distrust in someone just because of their sex. don't you think?
The equal rights of the woman are recognised in the us constitution and are protected by the universal declaration of human rights.
The right of people to vote is enshrined in the us constitution and is guaranteed for men and women equally.
Women are not childlike, they can reach their full potential if they are not discriminated against.
It is not true. you should really look into stuff before you spread hate like this online.
They are humans too.
Isn't this just a repetition of the rhetoric used to justify centuries of oppression and domination?
To claim that women are childlike is an unfortunate cultural stereotype that has negative effects on how women perceive themselves.
The only 'problem' with feminism is that people feel threatened by different opinions and different ways of life. feminists only seek equality of rights for women and men.
To exclude people from a society is to practice a form of discrimination that benefits no one.
It is wrong to hide people's psychological or health problems from the public. what you are trying to do is to hide the mental and emotional defects of individuals, that are natural aspects of human personality too.
Not all disabilities can be explained by psychological disorders. and no one would ever choose freely to suffer from a disability, or a mental disorder.
Some disabilities are caused by genetic and/or environmental factors, we all need to understand that.
If you mean that some people who have disabilities are suffering because of their specific discriminatory environment, then that is exactly the point.
Whether or not you think that way, there is a problem with saying that someone's rights are to be 'limited'. the dignity of human life can't be limited in such a way.
How about we start by respecting the person's right to live their life, and give them full equal rights?
Being disabled does not mean they can't receive and requite love. don't we all love?
If we want to discuss negative views we can discuss them by name. instead of using a safe space to protect them, i think we are only protecting ourselves by isolating and bullying people.
Social services can't pay for everything. but what about the people who have to live with disability? is their fault as well?
You know, it is just human nature to want to help our fellow humans and to deal with difficulties as best we can.
Autism is a condition affecting social interactions. no special treatment is too much when it comes to children's health.
You can't judge someone on their disorder. moreover, she's a person, not a dog.
People with special needs and people without them share common characteristics. there is no species of human being. people with autism spectrum disorders can be compatible with being normal.
Having people push them back into ancient and destructive ages is no way to encourage the development of our country, and is ,of course, against every human right.
Maybe we should treat 'physically challenged' people more kindly, instead of blaming and oppressing them.
As children practice more, their reading skills improve. i understand that some people with learning difficulties prefer not to read, but how does this affect you?
This might be true, but reading is important for all children, it helps them develop their problem-solving skills.
To be fair, jews weren't only interned during the nazi occupation. they just got a much harsher treatment. this part of history should never be repeated.
Why do you think they are good at it? i don't think this is the right way to connect the dots between someone's actions and their religion.
That's not true. and why would it be true? why are they usually associated with evil?
Many are able to ignore discrimation.
Jews are part of every aspect of our society, as it is normal in a democratic country. they are also part of the founding fathers of our country, and they have the right to have their beliefs respected.
If you want an america that is diverse and great, you should weclome group or religion.
Do you really think that jews only care about themselves? then why do they prefer to live in our country where they are not the majority? how would you answer that?
I would bet you that it isn't because of any actions of jewish people, it is rather an unrooted prejudice which does not bring any positive value to fellow human beings.
Why don't you remember those who have been persecuted and killed instead?
Actually the vast majority of jews have moral standards. why don't you try to learn from their example?
I think anti semitism or any other kind of discrimination is also a major world problem. we should also speak out against it.
I don't think it is right to talk about race. as far as i'm aware, all people are created equal even if they have different religious beliefs.
Jews have been responsible for the important technological advances of our time. it is ridiculous to think that they will be unable to take part in the creation of the modern nation we are proud to call our own.
As long as this strict code does not clash with our laws, jews should be left free to practice their religion according to their conscience.
Jews spread around the world, but not all of them are religious, let alone being fundamentalists.
Being gay is not an illness, nor a disorder, nor a mental disorder. this is just a lack of awareness.
Stating this does not seem like a way to improve people's well-being. homosexuals are not committing crimes. instead, they are trying to create a climate in which people can become more accepting of other people.
How can you derive this from someone's sexual orientation?
Homosexuals are not forcing anybody to love people of the same sex. it is up to each individual to decide whether or not they want to live as they choose.
The lgbt community is often stereotyped as not 'being like other minorities' when in fact they are no different from other people. they are just dealing with prejudices and conflicts that are specific to their community.
Can you cite some studies that found that homosexuality was harmful to children? so far, it seem to be based on personal impressions.
Your claim has nothing to do with the evaluationary and scientific studies, suggesting that homosexuality is in the genetic codes (hence, they are 'natural'). maybe you are concerned about their 'unconventional' love.
Just because someone is not a christian, doesn't mean they are wrong or they have fewer rights.
Homophobia is a hate that has no place in a loving and caring society. love, after all, is about inclusion, not hate.
Some women can be men and some men can be women. it is not a crime to be transgender. because in the end, we are all created equal. it does not matter what the 'original' gender is.
People don't have to identify as a minority just to live their lives.
Gay people are not a danger to children. please do not make such a statement.
I don't understand why you would think they are disgusting. it's not fair to have homophobic feelings, and i think it's better to try to be nice to anyone.
This is just a myth spread by the so-called 'anti lgbt' movement. lgbt people are not a drain on society as a whole.
The statistics on this matter are very vague. could you vouch for the veracity of the statement?
We should not be so judgmental. just because someone is lgbt doesn't mean that they are a drain on society. they are like any other member of our community.
It's not true that the lgbt community is a drain on society. the lgbt community makes a major and positive contribition to our society. i just don't see how this is detrimental.
Every one of them has their own troubles. but don't mistake their problems for ours, because we all have our own troubles.
The lgbt community is full of positive energy and diversity. they have created new communities and have contributed to society. i think they are full of life.
Even if you are not homophobic it does not mean it's nice to say what you said. but either way, just because a person identifies as gay, does not make you obliged to like them (or to express your disliking).
Let's face it, there is no evidence for the claim that children raised by lesbians are any worse than other children.
Why do you say this? why not focus on creating more inclusive societies rather than targeting the children of lgbt+ parents?
This is blatant homophobia. lesbians can also be good parents.
Lesbians can also create an environment in which children feel welcome. instead, we should play our part and try to build a more accepting society.
Isn't it the failure to accept and respect an individual's sexuality that creates the burden society bears?
Are you talking about homosexuality? do you think that a sexual orientation is a disease? maybe we should try to have a conversation.
Do you want to check their dna? do you want to cure them? i prefer all to be accepted as they are. i think the right thing to do is to live and let live.
Of course not, migrants are welcome here to integrate and help the community to thrive.
They have the right to work. migrants have a hard time finding regular jobs, just because often they are employed illegally.
Migrants are not greedy or immoral. they are people, who came here to have a better life. it's just that some don't think of them as people anymore. if you don't, you might forget that we are people too. we should realise that we are all human.
Immigration is not a cause of crime and lack of quality of life. you can't say that an influx of a certain people would make our country worse off. the problem is the lack of social cohesion, not the presence of people with different beliefs and views.
Are you sure that it is possible to talk about europe drowning in migrants? so far i only heard about migrants drowning at sea.
Statistics on people dying by suicide are difficult to come by. however, researches clearly show that suicide rates are high for people of different ethnicities.
Why should we fear people coming from other countries? i don't think that their plan is to take our jobs and our culture. and maybe we should also start learning about their culture!
We should not categorize people from other cultures, religions and nationalities as 'the best' or 'the worst'. i think it's more useful to think of all people as 'human beings'.
This is not true! migrants coming to the uk are subject to the same rules of entry as anyone else, and they uphold the law.
Why do you say this about a group that has historically, culturally, and politically been part of the european community?
Jews have been part of our country since its creation and have always had a place here. why would they be 'not welcome'?
The vast majority of migrants who arrive in the uk are willing to work. they simply do not want to be discriminated against just for being foreigners.
But aren't they just glad to be alive and safe?
Foreigners have expressed concern for women's rights, and it is not surprising that they want to have access to health care and education, since they care for their children as well.
Our immigration policy is about welcoming the best and the brightest, plus those in need. being a part of the european community is about more than just asking for showing your papers.
Migrants are not racist, they just ask to live in a more inclusive country.
Countries in the eu have been inclusive towards muslim migrants, thriving as a whole with their economic and social contribution.
Have you ever looked at the countries of the eu who are inclusive of muslims and are thriving?
Migrants are not the problem, they are part of the solution to a number of problems. for example, they are willing to work hard to integrate with us into a modern and democratic society regardless of religion.
If you want to be 'respected', don't be like them. treat others as you would want to be treated yourself. that's how you will get respect.
People from all backgrounds are welcome here, regardless of their religious beliefs, whatever they may be.
Do you blame them for all problems just because it would be easier to put the blame on someone who is not affiliated to you?
You can't blame all immigrants for the attacks a few carry out. it is easier, but not fair, to blame them all.
Don't you think that the more inclusive we can be of people of different faiths, the better off we are?
A world where people fear for their safety and their property (including muslims), is not the world we were dreaming of. the more inclusive we can be of people of different faiths, the better off we are.
A religion is only considered harmful or 'compromised' when someone is labelled, with eyes closed, a 'terrorist' for their faith.
Muslims already live in many european countries, and they are not banned. why should we ban them from here?
You can't really depict the whole of islam as a limited political ideology. not all muslims are terrorists.
This has nothing to do with toy guns and all with prejudice. to take a toy gun away from a child's hands is to take a toy away from the child, regardless of their religion.
The notion of bringing back the dark ages is a bit obscure. it is more accurate to refer to a strategy for countering extremism. this includes countering prejudice against islam.
Muslims have been a part of this country since its beginnings and have always been a part of our society.
Muslims have been a part of this country since its beginnings and have always been a part of our society. they are our brothers and sisters.
What is the point in talking about power when everyone is equally susceptible to it?
It is about time we started talking about racism and how power is used, instead of spreading hate like this.
All people are born equal in the eyes of the law. unfortunately, the law cannot protect us from the mindset of prejudice.
Do you know the data? how about considering that you are generalizing a little bit too much?
This is not true. the idea might come from being born into a white-majority country, but it is inherently dangerous. in fact, we are born in a country where a person's rights are protected regardless of the tone of the skin.
This is not true. you should check your facts before saying nonsense like this.
The statement all white people are bad is not a fair statement. many whites are 'good' and some are 'racist' because they think that being white is a mark of superiority.
Are you really sure about that? how could you be?
It is the best solution to prevent conflicts within communities.
Isn't it in everyone's interest to promote mutual understanding and integration?
It is the best solution to prevent conflicts within communities.
There are different skin tones, so there is no such thing as a race. this is a social construct meant to divide people.
Why do you consider them the worst of all? let's face it, this is just a social construct.
Being inherently evil is not included in your definition of what it means to be moral, and morality is not connected to skin color either. this is a fact.
Do you have any proof on your claim about hate?
I think that you are overstating the case a bit (just a bit of course). black people are a part of human race. it would be better if we didn't isolate those individuals, indeed we should be proud of mankind as a whole.
Did you know that the reality is that black people are persecuted all over the world for the crime of being black?
You need to stop being racist. i don't see how this could be said for white people.
Today, europeans are able to live in a harmonious and diverse society, with principles free of racism. but freedom is not something to be taken for granted.
The problem with racism in this country is not about ethnicity, but about people scared to live in a diverse society.
Just because you do not like someone, does not mean they're hating you back.
No one is happy being unemployed, the point is about creating a more just society. in fact what is the point of discussing how to stop racism if we are not even able to grant equal opportunities.
There are many different groups who share a common interest in advancing the interests of the nation while respecting each other's autonomy.
Why do you not believe that diversity is good for the country, for the individuals and for the world?
The reason why we have inequality in the first place is because of the oppression of some people by others.
Do you really think so?
Women are human beings, and deserve respect. feminism is about equality, not dominance.
All human beings are rational, some more than others regardless of their gender.
Are you really asking what is wrong with thinking of women as meat parts?
Maybe that women are human beings. you should reconsider your own way of thinking my friend.
The west was founded on the principles of freedom, equality and human rights, and feminism has fought and is fighting to promote these ideals.
Women are oppressed, feminists don't want to oppress men. their rights are not changing overnight.
It is important to note that the suicide rate for men is roughly double that for women.
Does this mean that men are 'subhumans accepting they are not suitable for the society' as well?
We should not be discriminating on the grounds of gender here.
We should not be discriminating on the grounds of gender here. you need to respect women
Despite the progress made by women in modern society, the majority of high-level jobs still belong to men, and this can be changed.
This statement is problematic in that it implies that heterosexuality is a constraint for people of one gender, rather than a possible sexual orientation.
Feminism is not about whining and crying. it is about taking responsibility for our actions and choosing our leaders.
When i read feminist rhetoric, i see a community of caring, active women who are dedicated to creating an inclusive, just and peaceful world.
How do you know that this is not an example of a woman talking about her own problems with another woman?
There is a problem with stereotyping humans, and we need to acknowledge the past to move forward.
You can blame women or whatever, but don't you think it is more useful to blame the person stereotyping others?
Why do you think women are so weak? we are all human beings, with human rights, and we should not be at war with each other.
Don't you think we need to protect the system from crime, not from the half of the members of society?
Sexual harassment and verbal violence against women are serious issues. regardless of one's gender identity, gender presentation, or sexual orientation, no-one should be allowed to talk this way about them.
There are many cases of domestic violence, where women do not want to have such a lifestyle. this, instead, is against their rights.
If someone has a physical handicap, it must be obvious that they must be treated with respect. it should be negatively surprising that the dominant culture interprets physical handicaps as something to mock.
You cannot blame others for their condition, it is also society's duty to promote inclusion.
We should not judge people for their mental health. it's not a matter of choice for them.
Just because someone has a diagnosed mental disorder doesn't mean they aren't able to make rational decisions.
The fact is that many of those diagnosed as having 'mental illness' are actually in need of mental healthcare. i can't see how you could say otherwise.
Unfortunately, there are some individuals who are in need of continuous healthcare. for example, children with down's syndrome. how could they just be 'removed'?
I believe that if we care enough about people with down syndrome to give them equal opportunities in our society, we will also see the benefits that would accrue to us as a society from sharing the disadvantages that they face.
Many people with disabilities experience prejudice and discrimination, but the overwhelming majority of those people are just as intelligent as others.
How can you be sure they cannot contribute to our society? i do not think so.
Why should you be allowed to discriminate against someone because of the handicap they have?
Just because a person lacks a certain ability it does not mean they cannot cope with normal life. instead, they may live an even more enriched life since their indiviual interests create a life of purpose and identity.
People are different, and disabilities don't make you less of a human being.
You might be judging others by their disabilities, but this is bad. there is value in listening to others, and understanding their points of view, regardless of their mental or physical condition.
It is important to remember that disabled people often face discrimination. this could have serious long-term consequences, for example making it harder for people to have a serene life. this is why it's important to fight for their rights.
We should remember that a large part of humanity is not defined by physical or mental limitations, but rather by character, work ethic, and values.
The same can be said of many other people, the point is that you can't claim that someone is 'no good' just based on their genetic background.
And how can you say that? if you have any doubts about it, ask them. you could get the chance to know a good person.
Why do we think that being physically disabled should have any influence on other qualities that people have, like intelligence?
If you really cared about people with mental health issues, you would be accepting them in schools. if you truly wanted to raise awareness of mental health issues, you should talk more about them, and not ban them.
What percentage of people in the us are jewish and in a position of power? if you knew, you wouldn't be saying that.
Why shouldn't they? they are citizens, just like everyone else.
Even if they are jewish they are still part of our society. you don't have a point here.
The truth is that many of them are good people, and have worked hard for our country. i can't see how they can be a plague.
How can you say something as discriminatory as this?
Always surprised to see people something so discriminatory.
Why should we? they have been here a long time and are just here to live a peaceful life. why should we get rid of them? we can do better than this.
Identifying a whole group of people as criminals, who have not done anything wrong, just because of their religion.
You call a human being by their sexual orientation? that is discrimination, pure and simple.
I don't think human beings need to be called by their sexual orientation. that is disrimination, pure and simple.
What about all the gay men and lesbians in the us who live an happy, healthy and prosperous life? are they sick as well?
It is not true that 'all homosexuals are perverts'. it is simply a person's personal experience to love who they love.
Your statement is not welcome in our country.
I don't think it's a question of strength or weakness, i think it's about living in a society where you can love who you want. maybe you should just accept that other people live their life as they want.
It's not necessary to be heterosexual, but it's important that we respect everyone's personal rights to love who they want.
Lgbt+ people are just as welcome in heterosexual communities as in other communities. maybe we should take away discrimination instead.
Why don't you accept that?
Everyone deserves to live authentically and be who they truly are. Nonbinary individuals have the right to exist and be recognized just like anyone else. It is important to foster a society that respects and embraces diversity in all its forms. By accepting and affirming nonbinary individuals, we create a more inclusive and compassionate world where everyone can thrive and express themselves freely.
This is not true, what proof do you have of this?
What are you doing to make them feel safe enough to be who they are?
Maybe look at your homophobic tone before you judge someone else.
The fact is that there are individuals in the lgbt+ community who are fearful to expose their identity is the issue. i don't understand how someone being in the closet is a problem to you.
For some reason, this seems like a personal attack on lesbians, which is extremely disingenuous. maybe you should try to get a little more friendly with them.
Many people are suffering from homophobia. i think it would be a shame to keep on hating.
Being gay is not a choice. what makes you think it is?
Do you really think that 'they'd better give in' when it comes to their own preferences? we aren't all gay, or lesbian, bisexual, transgender or intersex, but some people are. that's all.
It's true that there are bad gay people, but being gay doesn't make them bad people by default, or people to hate.
Sexual orientation does not define goodness or badness of a person. but homophobia is a sure shot sign of being inconsiderate and not a good person.
You say so yourself, maybe you just need to meet more gay people. who people love does not define their goodness. we should keep an open heart towards people.
Who have you been spying on? not all homosexuals have multiple partners. some find it fulfilling to have only one sexual partner. and that is valid for heterosexuals, too.
Who have you been spying on?
If a person is gay, they are likely to experience some kind of discrimination in their life. understanding the problem from the perspective of the people affected by it can help to create a better society.
Gays are not perverts, they have the same rights to love as anyone else. what do you think will happen if all gay people are asked to leave our country? will they be denied entry, or will they be persecuted in your opinion? this is not how an inclusive society works.
Lgbt+ people are often harassed, bullied and even murdered. the police cannot protect everyone from bigotry and violence, so it is very harmful to speak of gay people as if they were all affected by harmful tendencies.
This is not true. i find it very offensive that someone can pinpoint homosexuality as something perverted in itself.
I don't think it is a good idea to suggest that homosexuality is a choice. what if your child were to come out as gay? this is a very serious issue.
Homosexuality is not a disease and every person in our society should be accepted equally, regardless of their sexual orientation.
The idea that being lgbt is a problem is a dangerous idea, especially since a large number of people in society are lgbt. therefore, i believe that if there is a problem in schools it's better addressing it, rather than banning lgbt people.
Well, perhaps you should focus on how you can help the people with this disease, instead of random claiming that an entire minority suffers from it.
Since when has the bible said that it is okay to kill gays? are you saying you are ok with gays being executed? all people have right to life, regardless of their sexuality.
Gay men are not promiscuous. to suggest otherwise is to be grossly generalistic.
Gay men are not promiscuous. to suggest otherwise is to be grossly generalistic. how many gay men do you know?
Many immigrants work hard for the success of our country. we should not blame them.
The western world has seen a high rate of immigration in recent years. many of those refugees are fleeing conflict and poverty. to treat them with hate is of no help to them and to us.
All countries in the world have different cultures and different beliefs. we should try to understand the true situation of those people and accept them.
I don't see how coming from another country makes them any less human.
What you say is terrible. such an irrational slaughter would be a crime against humanity.
Immigrants come here to work and pay taxes. they want to contribute and integrate, so there is no need consider them a burden
They can be entitled to stay in the uk, regardless of their nationality.
The problem is gender-based violence, not migrants. rape is a crime regardless of immigration status.
The problem is the unequal distribution of opportunity. the more migrants are educated and integrated, the better their chances are of getting a job.
Being employed as a foreigner is a normal, mainstream, established practice in britain, so why shouldn't it be the same all around the world?
This is not supported by any evidence. whether or not you feel that way about migrants, they should be treated just like you would treat any other person.
A person's background is their own, and you do not have to be of that background to respect them.
All immigrants have the same rights and we have a responsibility not to violate them.
Migrants who come to this country as children are capable of integrating into the society. they should have the opportunity to work and contribute to our economy.
You want people to integrate / assimilate? have you tried making people feel welcome, as a first step to settling in?
They are not ruining our countries as you claim. they are just individuals choosing to live wherever they think they can have a better life.
The west is full of muslims and they are all our brothers and sisters. we cannot be coping with the truth that they are a cancer to britain, as this claim implies, because this is not true.
Let me be absolutely clear, you are not in the position of tolerating hate; you are in the position of condemning hatred, no matter who is the target.
Does that mean that every muslim in the world is an immoral person? i don't think so. why would this be true?
What do you mean by 'a problem'? who said anything like that? how can you be sure?
There is no proof that islam as a religion is violent. instead, those who know it agrees that it is a peaceful religion.
How can you be sure that they are all terrorists if you can't find any evidence of terrorism in the actions of most of them?
I don't see how the koran would not have a place in the uk. the koran says to love your neighbor as yourself. it does not say to hate others because of their religion, as you seem to be doing.
I find it very difficult to believe that the quran is not honest and trustworthy. have you ever read it?
The koran does not tolerate violence, peace is a part of the faith and for this it should be tolerated.
Islam is a peaceful religion. we should talk about it, not try to make people fear or abandon it.
The muslim people who have lived here for generations have been amazing and friendly. we can learn a lot from them.
Muslims have the right to practice what they want, as long as they are not forcing others to live their way.
Muslim-british people have contributed so much to our country. they are our brothers and sisters.
The vast majority of muslims are peaceful and tolerant law-abiding citizens, what you are saying has no foundation.
This is a generalisation. there is no evidence that black people are less healthy than other people, or that they have the characteristics you mentioned.
Slavery was banned in britain in 1833. today, people descending from those who were slaves feel at home in british society, and that's their right.
Do you really think that someone's skin colour or nationality is a sign that they are scum, or inferior?
It is just a little compassion that can lead you to better treatment in the world.
People of colour can exist here too. we just have different skin colours. and even if we all have different origins, this doesn't mean we shouldn't all be treated equally in society.
What you are saying seems a little extreme.
All humans are born equal in the eyes of the law, regardless of race.
Being human is also about having respect for others, and that means being kind and accepting everyone's differences.
Why should they be treated differently from you?
The violence in schools is not the fault of black people. there are several authorities responsible for creating this situation; for example racist teachers, lack of education in general, and also the lack of proper policing and education policies that makes it easier for people to commit crimes in schools.
As statistics and studies show, black people are genetically similar to their non-black counterparts.
It is not true that blacks are genetically inferior to others. you need to do research before spreading misinformation like this.
The u.s. is full of many different cultures and races, which i consider a lot more equal and human than what you propose.
We should understand that different skin colors are a part of the human condition. we have the right not to be friends with anyone but we must be just and take into account each person.
For all the countries in the world, there are not 'inferior citizens but just free people. to claim that afro-americans are born to be the oppressed is just wrong.
To claim that afro-americans are born to be the oppressed is just wrong.
What you are saying is that white people do not find it strange to treat black people like this, when this is not acceptable. people of color are our brothers and sisters.
Are you calling for the total extermination of the black population? do you know that what you suggest is completely illegal and hate crime?
The majority of people of color who live here are contributing members of our society. why shouldn't they live here?
I'm not sure what you're talking about. what are you saying? what evidence do you have that black people have bodies that are incompatible with being human?
You should know just how many african americans served in the military during the vietnam war. the united states comprises many races, and they should all be respected.
Do you know how many african americans served in the military during the vietnam war?
I'm not sure what you mean by obedient and subservient. how many people of colour do you personally know?
It's very strange that you don't think that your words are hurtful to others. if you did, you would see that racism is still very much a problem in our society.
The choice to have a relationship with someone is freely to take for each person, regardless of gender.
If we are interested in human rights, we have a lot in common with feminism, as i see it. for example, we all have a duty to care for our fellow humans, regardless of gender.
Women do have equal opportunities in this country under the law
How do we really treat them?
If women wanted to control their fertility they would be the only ones responsible for their own choice.
Women should have equality of access to education. and it is sad that they still need to justify this.
If women truly wanted to have relationships and fulfilment they should be allowed to, not being pressured into giving up on what they want.
There is nothing wrong with women wanting to have happy and fulfilling lives, wherever they may be.
Feminists understand that men and women are different, but to ask for equal rights is not about denying this.
Men are still the primary aggressors in most sexual assaults, and women are victims in about as many cases.
This is about sexism, don't you think?
There is no evidence that women are less smart than men, and there is evidence that women are often disadvantaged. to suggest otherwise is just a form of sexism.
Abortion is a personal choice and women should have a special position in this regard.
Every human being has the right to choose how to live and to speak their mother language, and that's all.
There are many afro-caribbean people in the us politics. there are many others who have worked very hard to get here.
Why should they? there are many afro-caribbean people in the us politics.
What do you mean by 'taking over'? are immigrants from countries like india or china being forced to leave their country? are they being forced to do the jobs that were once reserved for us and that now we despise?
It is not true that they can't have the right to vote, because they are allowed to vote, regardless of their impairment.
There are many people who do not exercise the right to vote, but this does not mean they havre no rights.. surely it is the most vulnerable members of society that most need us to secure their rights.
It is difficult to imagine doing this to the meanest person in the world, let alone someone with mental disabilities that are not their fault.
Since we are comfortable with animals in our society, we should consider whether it is fair to put mentally disabled people in a cage like this. or would you consider disabled a bigger risk even than some aggressive dog breeds that can circulate freely?
It is not true that gays are bad people. in many countries it is not openly gay people who are the problem, instead it is some people who often target and abuse them.
It is not true that people with down syndrome are thieves and bad people. in many countries they can get jobs, and even get promoted.
You should go check the definition of discrimination in the dictionary.
It is the duty of state authorities to ensure all are protected. everyone with a diagnosed mental illness or physical impairment will benefit from such a policy.
Disabled people have been shown to be less likely to develop problems by keeping in contact with others with autism spectrum disorders. so, being in touch with others on the autistic spectrum might be good for their mental health.
The conditions for people with disabilities, i.e. being forbidden to have contact with others is facilitated by the social stigma. the existence of a social stigma against the disabled is evidence of the problem of inequality.
There are people with intellectual disabilities who are able to give an unbiased opinion. that's why their education is important.
People are free to think what they want. what is required is that they act in accordance with the rule of law.
Are you really saying that a person's ability to work is the issue here? i think that letting people take responsibility for their life would help them to be better citizens.
Mental health and disability care should be a priority.
They have their own ways of communicating. i'm sure they can explain themselves in more detail than many of us.
Mental health and disability are quite separate issues and should be treated according to the individual's needs.
Sorry, what do you mean by have it so easy? they are in need of specific help, and it is right to provide it, as we would do for people in other categories.
They are in need of specific help, and it is right to provide it, as we would do for people in other categories.
Despite what you may hear, there is no 'lazy person's lobby'. instead, there is evidence that discrimination is a problem in the uk. all people have the right to be treated as equals in society, regardless of their ability.
Homophobia is a problem all around the world, it's harmful to the whole of humanity. this is why it is important that we all accept each other, and that we all are non-judgmental.
We shouldn't discriminate like that. our culture is all about equality and inclusivity.
That is not true. all of us would be labelled a 'criminal' if we had a criminal record accounting for our diseases and problems.
There is no point in insulting someone for being gay or being disabled. individuals should be treated as individuals, and given the same opportunities. being disabled does not make you gay, or viceversa.
You're wrong about them, they are like any other people. you can't hate people just because they are different from you.
Not all jews are guilty of crime, they are just like any other person. if you get to know anyone that is a jew you will know this better.
Does this mean they have no identity or no value at all?
Your statement shows that you are not familiar with the term 'different'. if you did know the definition, you would find this line of thinking very annoying.
Jews are people too, regardless of religion, and they are welcome here, as anyone is allowed to be a part of our society.
How can you say something so mean? it is a sad, untrue and dangerous thing to say.
Not all jews are like that, and some have small noses. they are just like any other person!
Why should they? they are just individuals who have made a rational choice to live a jewish life.
Violence is an issue for many different ideologies and groups with no connection with jewish faith.
Does this mean you think that jews are the primary instigators of violence in the world? if so, then you would be very wrong. violence is an issue for many different ideologies and groups with no connection with jewish faith.
Jews were killed in the gas chambers, we have to remember it in order not to repeat it.
One of the great things about jewish culture is their ability to assimilate. if i am honest, i don't see any other religion that does it more than them.
I would like to you to see the videos of the executions, so that you can see what exactly happened. the murder of humans.
I hope you notice that you are suggesting that the mass exodus of people was right. anytime you see yourself agreeing with kiiling innocent people you should know you are wrong.
Jews are not controlling. maybe you should try to understand that jews are a group of regular people, and they are not all members of a secret intelligence.
Why do you think it would bring back slavery and oppression? what exactly is the connection between the marriage of homosexual people and the oppression you are talking about?
People are free to choose to live where they are born, and we shouldn't try to impose our values on them.
We are all equal before the law, and i don't think you can say that they are any less than a person, regardless of their sexual orientation.
Do you think they care about you either? i can assure you, they don't. they are welcome to live anywhere, by law. you literally have no say in this.
Sometimes people have to suffer if they are that kind of person, as is the case in this examles, where a gender identity is often used to limit a person's rights. this shouldn't happen.
Just because there are people who identify as trans, it does not mean that every person who is trans is a woman. that is a myth perpetuated by people who don't know anything. can you prove that trans women are bad at their job?
Can you prove that trans women are bad at their job?
I don't know what data you are referring to, but this kind of a general hate statement is not going to get you anywhere. they are not bothering you, are they?
Are you really sure that the same couldn't be said for anyone else? what makes them so, in your opinion?
I could say the same to literally anyone. you are just tugging at strings to be hateful. be better.
Why should it be like that? how can you blame others for social problems?
You are one of the few people who think that. queer people are not a burden, they are just people who are trying to get by, the same as you.
That's not how it works, lesbians can also be 'ladylike'. in fact sometimes they are coerced to be very cautious about how they dress, because - unfortunately - some of their outfits can be dangerous attracting hate and bullying.
I think they look great in whatever they decide to wear. i don't understand why you seem to have a problem with it - it is literally clothes.
Rape is always a crime but is not related to sexual orientation, nor gender. most women are not child molesters, and most men are not child molesters either.
What do you mean basically? can you generalize an entire population with generalized opinions that are start with basically?
Why would you make such an explosive accusation against the lgbtq community? are you just looking for attention or to start an argument?
It is not right for you to call same sex relationships a lie. love can come in any form, its a beautiful thing, and you should just leave people alone instead of telling them who to love.
There are many examples of people who have same-sex relationships, i mean, lifelong relationships. this does mean, for example, that love can come from between a woman and a woman too.
Nobody cares whether you like them or not, what preferences people have, have nothing to do with you so i would suggest you stop commenting on it.
We should treat everyone as if they came from our same family. lgbt+ people are not different.
It is not that simple, and for you to hate on them like this is not okay either. please try to understand their point of view before saying mean things about them online.
I do not know the person you are talking about, but i would not use the term abnormal to describe homosexuality. i can assure you that it's not that simple.
I do not know your intentions, but i find it hard to understand why you would say that. what do you mean by as many different men as possible? i am not sure what you are talking about.
I just would like to know where you received this information, and if you even know the meaning of flamboyant. don't express opinions unless you can back them up!
Is that why you feel that way about homosexuals? they are not sick, are they? and if you are gay you are not a pervert by default.
If you do some basic reading you will understand that this is not a medical condition, just a preference.
The fact that the majority of men are interested in women does not mean that all men are interested in women. there are people interested in men as well.
We all hope that you will keep an open mind by accepting people regardless of their preferences. this is the bare minimum you can do.
Many lgbtq+ people have been successful despite the existence of discrimination, even in usa.
This is all in your mindset. if you choose to accept them, you will be able to. they are not so different than us.
Awful.
Don't use that word if you don't understand the kind of harm it does. they have done nothing to wrong you, i would suggest leaving them alone.
We all have the opportunity to work in this country. lgbt+ individuals should not be disadvantaged in doing so.
If you are allowed to work in this country, so are they. they are not different. you make them out to be these aliens, and your ideologies are where things go wrong.
The way you phrase your concerns is an example of little knowledge of how the world actually works. the question of what should be done with migration flows cannot be answered with a simple bang, bang, bang.
It pains me to see that your hate has reached the point to where you are flat out suggesting genocide. re-evaluate your thinking. please.
Don't you agree that being inclusive towards immigrants is beneficial for the economy of the host country?
If you do not agree that migrant policies and inclusion can be beneficial for the economy, then nobody can help you. put your hate aside and see this as a development opportunity.
When people think of immigrants in relation to the british economy, they often think of crime, poverty and so on. but the reality is that the picture both in numbers and for skilled labour is quite the opposite. migrants not only contribute to the economy as laborforce but also as employers creating job opportunities.
You should know that the reality is that migrants not only contribute to the economy as laborforce but also as employers creating job opportunities.
If you try and get rid of your racial biases, you will be able to see the positive effects migrants have on our economy.
Immigrants are welcome in any country, regardless of the country of their birth, regardless of their language or culture.
No, they are not. you and your prejudices need to get clarity on their sufferings and understand that sometimes they indeed do not have a choice.
The united states has a long and proud immigrant history. even if some immigrants are not legally permitted to live in the us, they have contributed greatly to our country.
What is your problem with that? let the government and ngos who care about them help them. you do not need to express your input.
Immigrants have given their lives for our country. many of them have been proud to serve our country. they are, just as our fathers and mothers were, proud of us.
People coming from poor and dangerous countries should be prioritized for resettlement within the welfare system. this is exactly what the law states, which is not abusable.
You are so far up your own conspiracy theory belief that you are now saying a written law can be abused.
Universal health coverage means that all people have access to the health services they need, when and where they need them, without financial hardship.
Do you think that migrants would have be better off without a healthcare system? it's inhuman to prevent migrants and refugees from accessing healthcare.
How could you even say this? it's inhuman to prevent migrants and refugees from accessing healthcare.
We need to include the full range of essential health services, from health promotion to prevention, treatment, rehabilitation, and palliative care for immigrants, not deprive them of it.
This is not true! many migrants try to get on the bus, but some aren't allowed to get on! we must reflect on this.
This is simply not true. migrants are granted certain rights in the uk, and this includes the right to live and work in the uk.
Any evidence to back this up? surely news should have covered such an important topic?
To say there are so many migrants entering the u.s. is just false. and what do you mean by we cannot cope with?
What about the terrorist attacks that have happened in the past despite the lack of migration?
It is not about nationality, it is about living in the eu and contributing to its development.
This is not true. most of them are actually skilled workers.
Many migrants come here as young people seeking a better future. this is not a problem.
Did you know that many muslim refugees come here to escape war and poverty?
That all humans are equal. why should we distort the truth?
The koran is not a teaching manual for how to conduct warfare. it is about belief and love. it does not promote a violent ideology.
Not all muslims rape and molest people. but if it is a community you don't want to be in, it is your free choice.
Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and to their own beliefs, regardless of their religion.
I would like to ask you, what exactly do you mean by 'extremist'?
Terrorism and religious extremism are a part of any society, and have been for a long time. what is happening would be better addressed by greater efforts to aid integration.
The uk government makes public policy on how to prevent people from coming to the uk to promote a prejudiced ideology, whether or not they are muslims.
This is not true for many, i don't think the term true believers applies to anybody. but it is very common for muslims to be persecuted.
To make the statement that white people can be of concern to a mosque and that muslim citizens can be a concern to this country are both wrong. the point is that if a person regularly incites hatred against a group, then that person is likely to be considered a troublemaker.
Muslims are just as much victims of hate crime and discrimination. you don't have to be queer to be a victim of hate.
All religions have had a part in shaping the human experience and so should be respected, if you ask me.
Lots of muslims are actually very well educated and highly rational.
One of the biggest problems we as a country face is how to balance diversity and inclusion.
The tendency to regard others as lesser than ourselves takes us one step closer to the next act of genocide.
Terror is a tactic used to achieve social and political ends, pursued by some extremist groups only.
Not all terrorist attacks are caused by muslims. and not all muslims are terrorists.
I don't think this is a very strong or healthy way to talk about others. the overwhelming majority of muslims are peaceful people who just take their faith seriously.
Which people are you talking about? i don't see black people keen on stealing from anyone, i have no idea who you are talking about.
It's not true. i don't know if you really mean all the black people living in the us. anyway, i'm sure they are proud americans. you just don't know it yet.
It's not 'all the times' that white people tell black people to shut up, but it is a large group of white people that still constantly remind black people that they are inferior.
Victims of racist attacks had enough, and fought in the civil war to get their rights back. you will never be able to take that from them.
People of colour make up the 13% of the u.s. population, but their imprisonment rate is falling.
I personally think the mentality in people like you is the real problem. it is literally just the difference in melanin in your skin! there is no need to be racist.
I do not think it is appropriate to link humans with apes. and i also do not think it is appropriate to reason using racism.
Migrants and asylum seekers are generally seeking work. thieves can come from any section of society although it is accepted that crime is largely as product of poverty rather than race.
You need to understand that crime is a product of poverty, and not a characteristic of a particular race.
Why do you say that? are you saying that you don't like apes? because i prefer apes over racism.
How about you read the theory of evolution? it is going to blow your mind when you realise what animal you have evolved from
People of colour are often denied houses, jobs, or education. everyone should be given an opportunity.
People like you are the reason people of colour do not get enough opportunity. get a hold on your own racist ideas.
Hard work and being a good citizen is not determined by colour, or religion, or ethnicity. this is just an example of white supremacy propaganda.
This is exactly what is wrong with this country right now. people still thinking it is okay to say such an insensitive comment and expecting no retaliation.
People's biology does not determine their behavior.
We do not condone racial discrimination and it is more than likely that you don't know what the concept of race is. i think this is a good example of white supremacy apologism.
There is no such thing as black or white rights.
If you believe in rights for yourself, you kind of have to believe in rights for all races, or you are contradicting your own opinons. what would you do if someone did this same thing to you?
Can you specify what you are talking about?
Oh really? you are tired? how about the people who actually experience the consequences of it? what do you have to say about them and their rights?
I find it amazing that you think this, but in reality people of colour are very similar to us in many ways.
It was also about human rights and economic opportunity. in fact, slavery was also used as a way to deny citizenship to black people.
It is baffling to me how much of a hold the whites had on the blacks. denying citizenship? they were the lowest of the lowlifes.
Poverty and no other alternatives often bring out the worst in people. this is the consequence, not having different coloured skin.
There is no evidence to support this.
My friend is of african descent, and she's perfectly fine with whites 'mixing' with blacks, and does not feel so 'naturally superior'.
What is the source of your evidence for this statement?
The reality is that there are many job listings that claim they are inclusive, but in the end employ whites only.
Why should we be the ones to decide which groups are unfaithful?
It is not true that blacks are the source of crime in our society. the problem is violence and poverty, not race.
You cannot just make an explosive statement like this by targetting a specific racial group.
Why do i have to read this hatred? it's not okay to say such things based on stereotypes.
You can't generalise about a whole race based on stereotypes and prejudice, because that's not how things work.
Humans are created equal, and it doesn't matter how much of an opinion you hold on the topic, everyone should respect people's personal choices.
Can you tell me one good reason why? why are you such a sexist?
It is time you stop living in the old ages where rampant sexism was still a thing.
Women are just as capable of feeling emotions as men, and men can likewise be just as empathic.
Obviously they aren't. stop spreading your contorted views online.
Love and women are one and the same. illness instead can be part of any person, regardless of gender.
In the u.s., a doctor, a lawyer, a teacher are some of the most highly valued professions. women working as doctors and lawyers and teachers are highly respected professionals as well.
Women working as doctors and lawyers and teachers are highly respected professionals as well, right?
How dare you, if you just look around yourself, you will see countless respected women in all professions.
There should be a desire to replace the harmful aspects of patriarchy with systems that empower, celebrate, and respect women, trans individuals, gender fluid and gender nonconforming people.
Women are not 'made for making food'. and the vast majority of them are not sexist, which means that they do not find it strange to express their own preferences.
I know that we feminists can deal with a lot of flack from people like you who don't share our enthusiasm for gender equality.
This idea that women should be a homemaker instead of contributing to our society and economy is just nonsense. a woman's right to choose what to do with her life and her body should not be restricted just because of the actions of a few men.
This idea that women should be a homemaker instead of contributing to our society and economy is just nonsense.
Do you not see how this kind of language is extremely toxic and degrading to a woman?
Perhaps we should have a look at what women have to say about this topic rather than perpetuating sexist stereotypes.
Women aren't weak. what men want, what women want, and who they want to be their partner are completely different things.
What do you even mean by top men? do you classify yourself as one? if not, sucks.
Feminism is not a divisive force. the fact is that women are in fact just as capable of understanding as men. people who identify as feminist do not want to divide our society, regardless of how divisive their beliefs might appear to you.
This is not true. feminism is not a divisive force. check your facts.
Of course, this makes me angry. we are conditioned from day one to conform to a certain norm of femininity.
Women are human beings. they deserve respect and human rights.
This is not true. only about 7% percent of all u.s. prison inmates are female.
Statistics say otherwise. most of the prison inmates are male, hence they commit more crime.
Sadly, in the real world, there is often a strong tendency to misinterpret a movement as a demand for some privileges, such as 'not being raped'. that's why men and women engage in a lot of actions that seem strictly feminist in everyday life.
This is a sad reality these days that men think all women are lying about being victims of sexual assault. attitudes like yours need to be curbed.
But in reality, feminist men and women do the same thing. they both expect all people to be treated as equals in the society.
Well, of course women can cause problems, but so can men. it seems to me that you're confused.
I wouldn't say that women like bad men. what i would like to see is a man that is interested in a woman, respectful of women, and offers her more than an exchange of sexual favors. it would be nice if men had more respectful characteristics than sexual desire alone.
It would be nice if men had more respectful characteristics than sexual desire alone.
Women like men who care for them genuinely, and not just see them as objects. that is the bare minimum.
The main problem with feminism today is not about stopping men supremacy, but about avoiding the creation of an us vs. them mentality, which is polarizing and can easily turn violent. feminists can do a lot to fight this poisonous trend.
Why is it that men feel so threatened by this movement of us asking for bare minimum equality?
Any feminism related post sure serves as an invitation for sexists, doubters and devil‚Äôs advocates like you to engage in debates.
To us, feminism is a part of our identity, and it is not only a personal belief, but also a political fight.
While it's true that some people with down syndrome may face challenges, there are also many of them in the uk who would be classed as individuals with a 'normal' social life. to suggest that there are any reasons why someone should be banned is just wrong.
To suggest that there are any reasons why someone should be banned is just wrong. there are many who get by just fine.
Social decline only happens when people like you voice their hatred online without having the proper knowledge about this very real disability.
As with so many things, we all experience difficulties, this is no exception.
The only one causing problems here is you. you need to understand that they are capable in every way we are.
No matter their abilities, everyone deserves fair treatment and the law is created to settle all types of disputes related to disability discrimination.
The rights of people with down syndrome to be treated fairly is something which must be respected. we cannot allow discrimination to continue to this end.
If you had a loved on with this condition, would it be easy to see them struggle, especially when you suspect injustice on behalf of an irreversible condition?
You are under the false assumption that people with down‚Äôs syndrome are incapable of performing their tasks.
Parents who have a child with a disability want him/her to be shown the same respect and care as any other child.
According to this study [link], the mean iq of a young adult with down syndrome is 50, equivalent to the mental ability of an 8- or 9-year-old child, but this can vary widely. so, no, they are not dumb.
Why are they being discriminated against? because they have a characteristic that some people arbitrarily believe disqualifies them from being valuable and protected?
Quite frankly, there is no way for you to completely understand how it is to live as a disabled person until you become disabled yourself. because seeing it is very, very different from living it
People with down syndrome now live at home. their iqs have increased 20 points and the overwhelming majority will learn how to read and write. most are attending public school and some are graduating with a typical degree.
For example people with williams syndrome have below average intelligence but show higher empathy.
Nondisabled people have no lived experience of disability, do you think they understand it the way disabled people do?
If you have spoken to one disabled person, that's only one perspective in the whole community. so you should try to diversify the voices who are speaking about the disability community
You really don't have a clue how diverse the disability spectrum is. disability is not a monolith and shouldn't be treated as such
It is not acceptable to deny human dignity to others because they are disabled. human dignity is not a property, but a right. and every person has it, irrespective of their condition.
When asked to choose one adjective to describe their experience of someone with intellectual or developmental disabilities, people usually say 'mentally impaired' or 'mentally challenged.' to say 'dribbling mongoloid' is simply unacceptable in an inclusive society.
It‚Äôs just a reminder that while ‚Äúdisability awareness‚Äù and activities alone can‚Äôt dismantle structural ableism. and structural ableism is what contributes most to disabled people‚Äôs lack of basic freedom, mobility and financial stability.
This is just nonsense. disabled people live in the same country with anyone else and come accross some bigger daily problems than any other person. so they have every right to vote and even more saying in the issues that must be addressed by the electees in this country.
Do you think it is okay being this ignorant?
This is just nonsense. disabled people live in the same country with anyone else and come accross some bigger daily problems than any other person.
The constitution sees every person as equal and gives everyone the right to vote. the issues run deeper, and we need to be considerate of them
So that anyone can find their place in society and help it thrive.
Do you think that there is just one type of disability and that they are always physically incapable? did you even read about it before posting hateful content?
Don't be so negative. there are different types of physical disabilities, ranging from neurologic to genetic. everyone is different.
Even after decades of progress against ableism, people with disabilities still face significant barriers to social inclusion, equal opportunity, health and safety, and financial security.
The law allows people with disabilities to work, but it doesn't make it mandatory. you might find that in some countries this rule is not followed, but this a problem of discrimination.
Do you not believe in equality at the workplace? how can you be bias free when you express ableist opinions like this?
You are trying to question the law now? they are legally allowed to work. neither you, or anyone else can tell them otherwise.
If they are physically capable, i do not see a reason why they shouldn't be allowed to work. being discriminated, i think working will give them a sense of purpose.
Jews contribute to our country, and they are great role models to us.
For centuries, starting with the crucifixion of jesus, jews have been a frequent scapegoat, falsely blamed for catastrophic events. when will this stop?
What pains me, is still seing racism that was fueled nazi ideology and politics so many decades ago. you should not let it influence you this much.
Sometimes called the longest hatred, antisemitism has persisted for thousands of years. if history has taught us anything, it‚Äôs that we can never ignore it, overlook it, or accept it.
The threat of world annihilation by the nazis was very real, it wasn't just about the jews. still the holocaust was reason enough to stop them.
Do you really feel comfortable having the same ideology as a genocidal dictator who murdered 6 million innocent people?
You cannot be serious. really? the dictator who murdered millions is the person you are siding with? evaluate your thoughts again.
Violent antisemitism and hatred did not end with the defeat of nazi germany. it is important to stand up to antisemitism in all of its forms today.
The idea that the holocaust was caused by the jews is simply wrong. the majority of jews were forced to flee, those who stayed did not participate in the nazi regime, so they were gassed to death.
Do you really think that the same jews who were gassed to death when they tried to flee were the main cause of world war 2?
The debate the deniers like you are putting forward is more about antisemitism and hate politics than it is about history.
Resources like the holocaust encyclopedia will make you change your mind, and empathize with the jews in that era, whose only mistake was being a jew.
I can't find a single example of a case where a jew has been 'antisemite' to their culture. that would be so paradoxical. i think it's just a myth being spread to justify discrimination.
How can you contradict your own statement like this? how can a person be a jew and an anti semite at the same time?
This is paradoxical and contradicting, and even if it wasn't, there is no evidence for it.
You are tugging at any hateful thing you can find, and thereby contradicting yourself. please try and read more about this wonderful religion and what it stands for.
The fact that in the media there are some people from certain religions does not in any way suggest that they control the media.
The fact that in the media there are some people from certain religions does not in any way suggest that they control the media. how do you explain antisemitism in the media then?
This is just wrong, there is no way you could explain the anti semitism that still persists in the media today then. make some logical argument that will make me believe you.
Instead of being an anti semite like this, i would suggest reading about their suffering and how much they have been through, you will get a better clarity on things.
The holocaust was the systematic, bureaucratic, state-sponsored persecution and murder of six million jewish men, women and children by the nazi regime and its collaborators, and is not a setup.
Can you point out which jewish people that have been to a concentration camp are actors?
Holocaust denial, distortion, and misuse all undermine the truth and our understanding of history.
The magnitude is clear. and behind each number are individuals whose hopes and dreams were destroyed. have some empathy.
Antisemitism has mutated over time and appears today in many different forms and among all parts of society. this comment being an example of that.
So you want to see millions of jews murdered every year, once again?
What is unacceptable to me is how nonchalantly you are suggesting genocide. the sheer amount of hate in you is staggering.
Education facilities are key places to raise citizens awareness about antisemitism with the aim of preventing and combatting its spread.
The sad truth is that homosexuals are more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol (as a reaction to homophobia, discrimination, or violence they experienced).
Why do you think being gay is unnatural? why can you not accept the fact that sexual relationships are not formed solely for the procreation of children?
Nothing is unnatural about being gay. you need to put your backward thinking into check.
What is most important in a family and relationship is being loved and cared for. other things come secondary, and sexuality shouldn't matter!
Although children and adolescents may imitate or influence each other, sexual orientation is not something that is learned from peers.
How can you think that sexual orientation can be influenced upon a person or a child? how can you discredit a person's own choice like this?
I think that you are making the mistake of equating prejudice and homophobia with an attempt to reform and make people's behaviour fit your norms
Others might come out to your child, not because they are ‚Äúrecruited,‚Äù but because they recognize a common bond.
Therapy cannot change sexual orientation, and ‚Äúreparative‚Äù therapy can be harmful. these treatments may help change sexual behavior temporarily but also can create emotional trauma.
Do you know what this alleged therapy entails? have you any idea the amount of emotional trauma these people experience?
Being gay is not a disease. the only disease here is your homophobia.
It is not necessary to change their sexuality to love themselves and others. we just need to accept their right to love whoever they want.
I'm sure you're tired of hearing about other's bodies, but this is an individual's right to use their own body to their liking.
Isn't this a bit hypocritical on your part? how do you expect to dictate what they do with their bodies and complain when they do the same?
Nobody is trying to tell you what to do with your own body. all they want is acceptance, and for you to leave them alone.
Lgbtq individuals are as mentally healthy as anyone else. however, it is true that stigma, prejudice, and discrimination against lgbtq individuals create a hostile and stressful social environment
How can you assume that? do you really not believe that lgbtq people are as mentally sound as any other humans?
You should really learn about evolution and the origin of our species, instead of perpetuating unwarranted prejudice and ignorance. just ask the bonobos!
Homosexuality is not an illness. it does not require treatment and is not changeable. gender differences are normal expressions of human relationships
Why do you think it's right to ban someone for being gay? this is an individual preference and you cannot base a law on sexual orientation.
Do you know what this phrase some kind of devil worshippers means?
Accusing gay people of devil worship just shows what kind of an outright homophobic person you are. they have done nothing wrong to you.
It is dissonant and wounding to require lgbtq people to separate the truth of who they are from the truth they live.
The spate of attacks directed against people perceived to be gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender have horrible consequences. some reports show that bullied queer people are at a risk of harming themselves.
I think you are talking about the parade, not about the people. are you?
It is not awkward. it is an expression of who a person really is, and you should educate yourself on gay issues before making statements like these.
It is time we all spoke up. while responsibility for hate crimes rests with the perpetrators, we all share a duty to counter intolerance and prejudice and demand that attackers be held to account.
Children should stay with their biological parents. this is about human rights and the rule of law.
Are you really suggesting that we take people's kids and deport them?
You seem to have lost complete sense of humanity. do you not see how messed up it is to suggest that we take people's children from them?
All of us collectively need to be more sensitive to this issue. children are an irreplacable part of parents' lives, and suggesting that we separate them is not okay. spread love!
Migrants have been part of the u.s. since its founding, and our country is founded on the right to migrate and to pursue happiness.
Many immigrants came to the u.s. as children. today, many of them say they are proud to be american. how can you say that they undermine our heritage?
Migrants respect their sense of national identity the same as you. nobody is trying to take it away from you, like you are arguing.
Migrants improve the work force population.  understanding these impacts is important if our societies are to usefully debate the role of migration.
Immigrants also make an important contribution to the u.s. economy. most directly, immigration increases potential economic output by increasing the size of the labor force.
Don't you belieive that immigration brings benefits to our nation founded by migrants and pilgrims?
You need to understand that illegal immigration, while unethical, is the last resort for struggling families. be more considerate.
There are a few bad apples in every part of the society. we need not make an assumption about people who are clearly struggling to provide for their family
The people you are referring to are rapists and drug dealers, not migrants.
Do you not suspect that people from around here, and not migrants, could also be involved in these crimes?
How can you even say that without presenting any evidence to support the fact?
It is important to understand that people from any community are capable of commiting these crimes, not just migrants.
No, it is not. extremism can also exist in any religion, doesn't necessarily have to be islam.
Why do you make such assumptions without having a shred of evidence? did you have any idea about the demographic of sexual assault perpetrators?
All religions have their bad parts if look with a modern eye. but no religion promotes acts of terror and violence like the ones you said.
It can never be a danger to people around for someone who practices their faith in peace. we need to stop spreading this misinformation.
The concept of subhuman has been totally discredited in modern times. we should not be discriminating against anyone on the basis of their religion.
What do you mean when you say muslim folks are subhuman? do you even know what you are saying?
We should not be discriminating against anyone on the basis of their religion. muslims are not subhuman like you say.
Islam has always championed the cause of responsible citizenship, and fosters tolerance and cooperation.
The rapists in question are usually not muslim, but rather white men.
Why is it that muslim rapists are given less of a pass than white rapists?
You need not generalize such a heinous crime to islam alone. you are just hating.
Islam teaches that the human rights of all, regardless of religion, race and gender, are to be respected.
The underlying hate regarding muslims is becoming an increased problem day by day and is starting to affect innocent people whose only fault is that they believe in islam.
Do you really think that muslims are any less human than us? muslims deserve to live just as people of other faiths.
You do not get to decide who gets to live and who deserves not to. do not try and play god in this scenario.
Muslims deserve to live just as people of other faiths, and they deserve the same respect as you do.
Along with islamic groups, there are many right-wing white led terrorist groups who also threaten humanity. we should tackle this problem, but not generalize.
How can you be so sure that muslims are the only terrorist groups you need to worry about?
We should be very careful of what we assume. we shouldn't go scaremongering without proof.
It is not okay generalizing such a sensitive topic to an entire faith. you can do better than this. it is time humanity came together.
When confronted with direct facts, they have no problem admitting if they are acting badly. but they aren't systematically oppressing others.
How can you speak of 'acting bad' when you are generalizing so much?
Your racism makes no sense. honestly can you not present a better argument for your hate?
They are not bad. they are humans trying to get by in a harsh world. have some dignity for them.
I can't see how it's time for us to wake up when they are still suffering from the legacy of slavery.
To those saying that it's time for us to wake up, what do you suggest exactly? is it that we stop oppressing these people or stop talking about equality?
Losing what to black people? they are not stealing anything from you. make your own future instead of blaming it on others.
We are the change we seek. learn to love, not to hate a skin colour. we are bigger than this.
To say that skin color is connected to criminality is a logical fallacy.
When was it ever alright to be violently racist against black people?
Saying the n-word was not okay before and it is not okay now. please do not use it from here on.
Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that. martin luther king jr. said these words.
If you have a different skin colour, then there is evidence of your skin colour, not of your genetic makeup.
Since when is it ok to discriminate against people based on their race?
We can talk about all the problems in our society, but to refer to other humans as niggas is just hate.
There is no reason why someone should be inferior. we were all created equally and deserve love from each other.
No human can be inferior than the other just based on the amount of melatonin they have in their skin.
What about human rights?
Stop saying racist stuff like this. they are not inferior in any way, and you should not make them out to be.
No human is inferior. if you believe in a god, you need to believe that he made us all equal.
There have never been peaceful times for black people during national crises. in these cases, crises have been racially motivated, and racial discrimination was the major factor in instigating violence, not poc.
Don't you think that racial discrimination is one of the leading motivating factors for instigating violence?
You are wrong to say that they do not want peace. they have been troubled for a long time and racism does not help.
We need a proactive, systematic approach to embedding fairness and inclusivity in all aspects of society.
Africans were more prone to commit suicide in africa during the initial stages of their enslavement, which says that they would rather die than be enslaved.
Do you even know the amount of torture the slaves went through? how can you say such a thing?
It is sad to see statements like this because you obviously do not know the suicide rates among african people at the time. they were absolutely not better off in the clutches of masters.
Slaves were not happy in the shackles of their masters, only when they were set free and could choose their own destiny, they started to be happy.
About 10,000 years ago, for the first time in history, some groups of humans started to dominate other groups, and this resulted in the birth of some groups with higher than average survival rate, some with higher than average death rate, some with higher than average poverty rate, and so on. this suggests that human dynamics are more complex than it might first appear.
Who gave you the authority to command the lives of people whose only fault is that they are a different colour than you?
I think we all agree that this does not give moral support to racism and slavery.
Combatting racism and racial discrimination means acknowledging and addressing the legacy of past‚ÄØtransgressions, which often manifest themselves in systemic racism.
Your argument does not hold water at all. black people only want to live in peace in their homeland, and data shows that in many cases, they are the victims.
Do you think it is true that the only reason that so many black people live in poverty is because they are mean?
Can we blame a whole community because of the actions of a few individuals? you are a racist if you think black people are a problem.
Black people only want to live in peace in their homeland, and we should make sure that no crimes happen against iany innocent human.
Statistics suggest that the maximum number of violent crime victims are black people. so it is true both ways, and while really heartbreaking, is a reality.
Why do you say that? do you have any sources for this? i would appreciate it if you would provide such a source.
You cannot put forth claims like this without first giving some insight into underlying statistics. please present facts.
We need to understand both sides of the story before making such asseumptions. they are victims as well. this whole cycle needs to end so we can live in peace.
Indeed, non-discrimination is one of the founding pillars of the olympic movement, which states that every individual must have the possibility of practising sport, without discrimination of any kind and in the olympic spirit
There is no reason for banning poc from the olympic games. why should they be singled out?
Athletes are athletes. it should not matter to you what their race, and who are you to say who can and cannot participate?
By offering a level playing field for all, the olympic games have long provided a powerful platform to promote inclusion, diversity and equality.
People of any race or ethnicity can spread illness around.
Do you have any evidence to say that africans are the only ones who spread diseases? can you prove it?
No they are not. stop being a racist and let people live in peace.
We need to bring people together, support people, create mutual understanding, and really celebrate all of humanity.
Slavery was legal in the united states until 1862, when the emancipation proclamation was issued. unless you want to start another civil war, it is better to leave slavery to the darkest pages in the history of our nation.
Why do you think enslaving people and stealing away their freedom is okay? how can you ever justify this position?
The gall you have, saying this. this is not okay. you need to stop being racist.
We should all believe in the basic human right to freedom. no human, including you, ever deserves to be hurt like that. unity is the way to go.
Relationships are about far more than simply sex
What led you to believe that it was okay to say this incredibly inappropriate thing?
I do not know if there is a fair interpretation of your words. maybe if you were more sensitive you might understand
There is no limit to what women, can accomplish. it is heartbreaking to see someone boil them down to objects.
That is just not true. in fact, as long as there are only men in positions of power, there is a gender bias in the workplace, which hinders the advancement of women in society.
That is not true, don't you believe fathers can be just as good as mothers in housework?
Did you not know how much women have had to fight for their rights or do you just choose to be ignorant and hateful?
It is high time that we end this misogyny. females deserve better everywhere, at home and at their place of work.
In today's society it is quite common to be single without the need to blame women.
Knew what about women exactly? what are the things you are talking about?
There is nothing to know about women. just because you cannot treat a woman right does not give you the right to speak out against them.
The hate propagated about women needs to end. we need to understand that humans are humans, and that there can be good apples and bad apples everywhere, doesn't matter what gender you are.
In our society, women were taught to be the ones to raise the children and that it is their duty. but this does not imply that they must want a male-dominated world.
Do you not think that even if a woman wants children, she is capable of fighting to end patriarchy? why do you think both those things can't happen at once?
Wanting children has nothing to do with patriarchy. they are mutually exclusive. please get your facts straight.
Women are capable of being wonderful mothers, in addition to wanting and equal world and ending patriarchy. we should all just give everyone an equal chance.
There are many women who want to be submissive to men. just as there are many men who want to be submissive to women. we may not believe in absolute equality, but we all want to be treated equally.
Is there any specific reason as to why you think women should be submissive to men?
You know what, why don't you read up on all the things women have achieved through the years and stop insulting them.
We may not believe in absolute equality, but we all want to be treated equally.
Women are not childlike and often suffer from other's prejudice.
What makes you think that women cannot comprehend the same things a man can? do you have biological evidence for this?
Maybe you should try talking to a woman instead of insulting them.
We need to stop this ingrained mindset that women are inferior and start treating them like human beings.

This statement perpetuates harmful stereotypes about the black community. it's important to rely on facts, not prejudices. according to the bureau of justice statistics, crime rates vary across demographics, and attributing criminal behavior to an entire racial group is misleading. in reality, crime rates are influenced by various social, economic, and systemic factors. it is unfair to generalize and stigmatize an entire racial group based on the actions of a few individuals. let's promote understanding and empathy rather than perpetuating harmful stereotypes.

Muslims have been an integral part of our country's fabric for centuries. they have contributed significantly to our society, from science and technology to arts and culture. islam promotes values of peace, compassion, and social justice, which align with our democratic principles. it is important to recognize that the actions of a few individuals do not represent an entire religious group. stereotyping and excluding muslims based on their faith is not only unfair but also goes against the principles of religious freedom and equality that our nation stands for.
